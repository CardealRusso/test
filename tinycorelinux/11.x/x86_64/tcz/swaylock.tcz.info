Comments:       Before using you will need to create a password for 
                local login.
                You may like to persist the password files over reboot?
                etc/passwd and etc/shadow 

                To LOCK
                $ swaylock -f
                which daemonises the locker and locks screen

                To UNLOCK
                <type passwd> You will see a circle appear and a change in indicator
                upon each press.......When you have typed full password, press Enter
                
                If you mistype ---a visual indicator appears,
                you can try again
                man page show extra configs
