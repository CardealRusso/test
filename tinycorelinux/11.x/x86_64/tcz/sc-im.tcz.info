Comments:       sc-im is an ncurses spreadsheet program for terminal
                that is based on the good old SC. It is actively
                developed by Andrés Martinelli under the 4-clause BSD
                license. As an improved version of SC it adds
                functionalities like:
                * UNDO / REDO
                * 65.536 rows and 702 columns supported. (The number of
                  rows can be expanded to 1.048.576 if wished).
                * CSV / TAB delimited file import and export.
                * XLS / XLSX file import.
                * Key-mappings.
                * Sort of rows.
                * Filter of rows.
                * Cell shifting.
                * 256 color support – screen colors can be customized by
                  user, even at runtime.
                * Colorize cells or give them format such as bold or
                  underline.
                * Wide character support. The following alphabets are
                  supported: English, Spanish, French, Italian, German,
                  Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, Turkish, Czech,
                  Japanese, Chinese.
                * Implement external functions in the language you
                  prefer and use them in SC-IM.
                * Also use SC-IM as a non-interactive calculator,
                  reading its input from a external script.
