Comments:	----------
		Now managed by IANA, this is the international timezone database
		started by Arthur Olson. State the POSIX-Extended TZ value in
		your kernel boot line:
			tz=Australia/Melbourne
		To change the tz on the fly, just
			export TZ=America/Chicago
		To search the possible TZ values, use
			sudo /usr/local/etc/tzselect
		This build has no dependencies. Modifications:
			sets LOCALTIME=UTC (instead of GMT)
			sets tzselect to use /bin/sh (instead of /bin/bash)
			ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo* /usr/local/etc/zoneinfo*

		If the tz bootcode is used, this extension creates /etc/localtime 
		as a link to the corresponding file in /usr/local/share/zoneinfo.
