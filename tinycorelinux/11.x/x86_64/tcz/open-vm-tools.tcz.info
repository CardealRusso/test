		----
		Download and install in console before reboot; do not install while in X.
		Use /usr/local/etc/init.d/open-vm-tools (e.g. /opt/bootlocal.sh) to control vmtoolsd service
		Verify permissions for /dev/fuse are 1666.
		Logging in should create a /mnt/hgfs-${shared folder name} mount point and mount each enabled shared folder
			If not run /etc/profile.d/open-vm-tools.sh
			Make sure the shared folder path is not in /opt/.filetool.lst or backups will fail
		Xorg and its dependencies are not needed for text only VM's.
