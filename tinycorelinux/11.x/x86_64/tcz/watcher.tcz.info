Comments:       The latest watcher, now available as an extension.
-
		Use the X standard -g option to position watcher where-ever
		wanted. X counts from top-left, so watcher in top-left corner:
		watcher -g +0+0
		Top-right would be "-0+0", bottom left "+0-0", bottom right
		"-0-0".
-
		To start watcher on X start, add to .xsession:
		[ $(which watcher) ] && watcher -g +0-0 -bat BAT0 &

                For more options, run  watcher -h
-
		This extension is PPI compatible.
