Comments:       - for eject button, you need either yad.tcz (and some kind of panel) or wbar.tcz
                - user settings go in ~/.config/usb-automount.conf
                - usb-automount.conf should have these four lines in any order:
                    mount_dir=/mnt # or /media or any directory you want
                    file_manager=xfe # change to whatever GUI file manager you use
                    icon=/usr/local/share/icons/eject.png # or any other icon
                    icon_method=wbar # must be either wbar or yad
