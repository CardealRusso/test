                This version of iridium is based on chromium 73.0.3683.103, with privacy enhancements and built-in libre codecs
                (including h264 support)
                ----------
                This extension is the binary package provided by the iridium developers (iridium-browser_2019.04.73-1iridium0_amd64.deb)
                converted into a Tiny Core Linux extension. The only change I made was the addition of /usr/local/share and
                /usr/local/tce.installed directories
