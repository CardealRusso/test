Comments:       A code searching tool written in C and similar to ack
                (perl), with a focus on speed. ag is designed as an
                alternative to grep for programmers. ag searches the
                named input FILEs or DIRECTORYs for lines containing a
                match to the given PATTERN. By default, ag prints the
                matching lines. If no FILE or DIRECTORY is given, the
                current directory will be searched. ag searches
                recursively by default, while ignoring .git, .svn, CVS
                and other VCS directories.
