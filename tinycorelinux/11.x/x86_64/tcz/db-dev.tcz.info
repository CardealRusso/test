Comments:       Reverted to DB version 6.0.19 because beginning with 6.0.20 and up the
		license was amended to require that anyone using the software must also
		allow free access to the software it touches, i.e. web applications, etc.
		OpenLDAP specifically calls out versions 6.0.20+ as incompatible with their license

Current:        2016/04/24 Last version, 6.0.19, unless Oracle reverts the changes to the license
