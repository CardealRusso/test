                Notes on terminal support:
                  - to be able to launch terminals from within geany you need to install vte.tcz
                  - Edit > Preferences > Terminal > check "Execute programs in the VTE" to
                     use message window's built-in terminal or leave unchecked to use external terminal
                  - if using external terminal, you may need to adjust two more settings:
                     1. Build > Set Build Commands > next to Execute, type (for example): "./%e"
                     2. Edit > Preferences > Tools > next to Terminal, type (for example): urxvt -e /bin/sh %c
