Comments:   Some of us load TCEs after booting. File managers like
            pcmanfm and spacefm do not auto detect freshly loaded TCEs.
            If any new loaded TCE offer mime handling, consider 
            running this app.
            
            If you see the next line, it means no new desktops
            were detected.
            "The databases in /usr/local/share/applications/ 
            could not be updated."  ^ = (above-dir used below)
            
            Be aware that if you attempt to open something in a 
            file manager, and you have no option to open it with a 
            TCE.....check that your preferred desktop file mentions 
            your target mime type.
            
            mime types include txt mp3 mp4 pdf html and so on.
            Look under /above-dir/something.desktop for the line 
            that starts with MimeType.
            If not found, consider reporting by pm or forum post to 
            the downstream maintainer. 
            
            In pcmanfm and spacefm, it is not necessary to close and 
            restart it, to see new mime type TCE options after running 
            this exe
            
            You can copy from /tmp/tcloop/etc the bin file to 
            ~./local/bin/ if you prefer not to have this TCE in 
            your boot list
