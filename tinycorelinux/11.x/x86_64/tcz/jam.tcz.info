Comments:	Jam recursively builds target files from source files, using dependency information
		and updating actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written in jam's own
		interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled into jam and provides a boilerplate
		for common use, relying on a user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and
		sources.
