Comments:       Based heavily on Tiny Core screenshot.sh, this script
                captures a single window rather than the entire screen.
                When run, the cursor changes to a crosshair. Click on
                a window to save a .png of it in your home directory.

                - Select desktop free space to take a screenshot of the
                  entire desktop, including taskbar and open windows
                - Can run from terminal, example 'sleep 10 && windowshot'
                  allows time to manipulate windows before crosshair
                  cursor appears
