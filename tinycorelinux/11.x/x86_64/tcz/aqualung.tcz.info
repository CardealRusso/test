Comments:       Ensure sound works for Alsa as no pulseaudio built in.
                To keep size smallish, only wav, ogg and mp3 supported.

                There is about 5 second delay before play button works. YMMV
                If you try to add a file and it does not appear in your list,
                its not a format I have compiled support for.

                Click the MS or PL buttons  to toggle on/off the music 
                store or playlist.
                For a right hand mouse user, RH click nearly anyone in the GUI
                will bring up a control panel.
                You will probably want to adjust DSP -> sample rate converter

                There is a volume slider and a left-right channel slider at top.

                Optional dep of aqualung-skin.tcz for more skins

                To play audio disc, ensure MS button is on. 
                 -------CD Audio should appear in store.
                Double Left click it to add to your playlist.
                Click the playlist entry. click play to play entire cd.
                To play a specific track, click the button to the left of 
                cd-name and choose track then click play at top. 
                Or use the MS playlist menu to add a specific track 
                 to your playlist.

                You can not rip and play audio cd at same time.
                In case its not obvious....to rip try this
                After seeing audio cd-name in MS,
                RH click that name, select rip in context menu that opens
                You can now choose all or one track etc
                "Output Tab" choose output formats of wav,ogg or mp3
                 --if you choose ogg or mp3 Variable Bit Rates can be changed.
