Comments:       The Perl script colordiff.pl is a wrapper for 'diff' and
                produces the same output but with pretty 'syntax'
                highlighting. Colour schemes can be customized.
                The sbin script coldif.sh is a convenience wrapper which
                sets up side-by-side diff output for viewing with the
                less command.
