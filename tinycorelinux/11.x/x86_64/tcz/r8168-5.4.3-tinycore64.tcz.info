Comments:	RealTek driver for RTL8168B/RTL8168E/RTL8168H
		PCIe NIC.

		If the standard Linux r8169 driver is unreliable or
		not working at all, this official driver often works
		better. Block the r8169 driver from loading by adding
		the bootcode "blacklist=r8169", and load using:
		 insmod /usr/local/lib/modules/5.4.3-tinycore64/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/r8168.ko.gz
		Add that line to /opt/bootlocal.sh to make permanent.

		Note that although GPL licensed, this driver is commonly
		considered to be "non-free" (due to patents?).
