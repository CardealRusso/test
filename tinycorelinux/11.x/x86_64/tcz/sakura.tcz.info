Comments:       Terminal for gtk3 users. Can support UTF-8

                Does not have a menu bar but has a context menu (GUI)
                First run creates the config file at ~/.config/sakura/sakura.conf 
                or to start afresh delete config and re-run the term.
               
                NO font dep has been set, but a default has been attempted.
                Do not edit that file for font names or sizes please.
                I noticed a diff in font names so I recommend you use
                context menu -> options -> select font
                eg Sans Regular 16  
                Config line reads Sans 16

                The config file does not mention that the action keys
                for certain keyboard combos is hold Ctrl and Shift = C+S
                Toggle on/off scroll  C+S s  (or use GUI)
                Copy = C+S  c (or use GUI)
                Paste = C+S v (or use GUI)

                The "+" sign is used for next line.
                Increase/decrease font size = C "+" / C -
