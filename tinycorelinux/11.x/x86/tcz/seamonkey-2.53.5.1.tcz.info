Comments:       This version of SeaMonkey makes changes to your profile
                that can't be reverted in the case where you want to go 
                back to a version earlier than 2.53.1. You MUST absolutely 
                do a full backup of your profile before using this application.
                If you are using NoScript you might encounter a certificate error 
                when trying to download SeaMonkey from this site. NoScript tries 
                to force an https connection for an http only site. It is not a 
                NoScript problem but how the Mozilla server, from which downloads 
                are delivered, is configured.In this case please add 
                download.cdn.mozilla.net to the NoScript "Never force secure 
                (HTTPS) connections" options or turn off NoScript for this download only. 
                The settings are located in the NoScript options under "Advanced->HTTPS".

                Suite contains: internet browser, email & newsgroup
                client, HTML editor, IRC chat, web development tools.
                Built on the open source Mozilla Gecko engine, same
                code that underlies Firefox and Thunderbird.
                SeaMonkey benefits from the cross-fertilization with
                these projects by gaining new features and security
                updates. The Mozilla Foundation provides hosting and
                legal backing for the SeaMonkey Project.
