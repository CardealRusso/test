Tags:		udev extension for computer model specific key mappings.
Comments:	This is particularly necessary for the non-standard extra keys found on many laptops,
		such as "brightness up", "next song", "www browser", or "suspend". Often these
		are accessed with the Fn key.
Change-log:	2012/07/31 Added more rules and new extension udev-keymap
Current:	2012/08/11 Added option to avoid overwriting tc rules
