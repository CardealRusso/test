Comments:       A must for extension-making

		Advdef and advzip of AdvanceComp included. They
		are used to repack zlib streams using an improved
		algorithm, saving space. This does not affect decompression

		Advdef handles png, and anything gzipped (tgz, svgz..)
		Advzip handles zip files

		With png files the usual saving is about 20%, with gzipped
		files about 10%.
		This extension is PPI compatible
