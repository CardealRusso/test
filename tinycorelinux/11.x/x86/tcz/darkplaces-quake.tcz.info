Comments:         Rage through levels of sheer terror and fully immersive sound
                and  lighting.  Arm  yourself  against  the cannibalistic Ogre,
                fiendish Vore  and  indestructible Schambler using letal nails,
                old reliable shotgun, fierce Thunderbolts and abominable Rocket
                and Grenade Launchers.
