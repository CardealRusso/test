Comments:       StrongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation.
                strongSwan originally was designed for Linux, but has since been ported
                to Android, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Windows and other platforms.
                The focus of strongSwan is on:
                'simplicity of configuration
                strong encryption and authentication methods
                powerful IPsec policies supporting large and complex VPN networks
                modular design with great expandability

                You can ignore the 'modprobe: module <name>  not found in
                modules.dep' messages. TCL hase these options build into the kernel.

                The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
                If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-4.x.x-tinycore.tcz via
                the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-KERNEL).

                Configuration templates are located in strongswan-doc.tcz.
