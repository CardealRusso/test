Comments:       PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy
                for sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on your
                sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware.
                Things like transferring the audio to a different machine, changing
                the sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one
                are easily achieved using a sound server
                ----------
                howto:
                alsa needs to be working for whatever sound device you have.
                Create dbus entry for booting into X
                $ echo  'dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session' > ~/.X.d/dbus
                $ /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus status [Check dbus is running]
                If not running, start dbus with
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus start
                If dbus was not, initially running, add a command to start it next reboot
                $ sudo echo '/usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus start' >> /opt/bootlocal.sh

                exit to console
                startx
                $ pulseaudio -vv [to test]
                When it is running correctly
                echo "start-pulseaudio-x11" > ~/.X.d/pulseaudio
                ----------
                if a bluetooth sound devices is paired and configured, pulseaudio
                should find it automatically if the daemon is running
                ----------
                use pavucontrol to switch source & control volume
                ----------
