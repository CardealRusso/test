Comments:	To start wicd daemon add to your boot script (/opt/bootlocal.sh):
		  /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
		  /usr/local/etc/init.d/wicd start
		For persistency add to your backup list (/opt/.filetool.lst):
		  usr/local/etc/wicd
		  var/lib/wicd/configurations
		It is recommended to add wicd.tcz to your onboot list and reboot for the first time.
		Optional dependency:
		  notify-python for desktop notifications (a notification daemon needs to be running)
		Please note that some wireless chip drivers require a firmware to work so please
		make sure you have the correct firmware loaded. See firmware, firmware-iwlwifi and others.
