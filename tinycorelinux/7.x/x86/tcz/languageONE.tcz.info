Comments:       languageONE is a collection of NASM macros that disguise the
                calls to routines in statically linked object modules.
                The linked routines themselves provide 64bit services to the
                application programmer. It includes macros that are used to 
                ensure data is structured in a way that these routines may 
                easily manipulate that data. The macros are built in such a 
                way that the application programmer would feel that they are
                programming in a higher level language
                
NOTE:-			The languageONE translator and the languageONE GUI make utility 
				are languageONE programs themselves.
				GUI-makeONE will need to be Translated/Assembled and linked before
				it can be used. 
					ie. makeONE.sh GUI-makeONE
