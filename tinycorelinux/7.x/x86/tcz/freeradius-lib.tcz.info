Comments:	The FreeRADIUS Server is a daemon for unix and unix like 
                operating systems which allows one to set up 
                a radius protocol server, which can be used 
                for Authentication and Accounting various types 
                of network access. 
                
                Shared libraries needed to run freeradius 
                and probably some other tools using radius.
                
                Compiled from source for TC 5.x/6.x.
