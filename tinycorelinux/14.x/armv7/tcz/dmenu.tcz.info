Comments:       A tool that can search executables on X (or Sway) 
                Then attempts to launch the highlighted entry           
                when you press the Enter key. Search is not a fuzzy but exact.

                How to run on X (tested on jwm)
                ###############
                $ dmenu_run 
                For a large font $ dmenu_run -fn sans-20

                Search bar will appear at top of your monitor
                
                Use arrow keys with numlock OFF to navigate to
                your target command or type more letters

                If you pressed enter, you are attempting to 
                launch the highlighted item and dmenu closes.
                Be aware not all commands are meant to be run 
                without parameters - options etc 

                If you change your mind press the Escape key. 
                While dmenu is active, you lose kb combos.

                If your search input is for a non-executable (eg) "lll" 
                you lose all hits and if you forget to Escape and press enter 
                you are launching a missing executable called "lll" and will get
                a not found error.

                ##################
                Press keys logo (and) d to start dmenu
                Follow above for the rest.
                
                Possible Glitches
                #################
                On fvwm, dmenu may cover any open app that is
                at the top of your monitor. So to close an app,
                you may have to either launch an app or press escape,
                while dmenu active.
                You can safely ignore any msg about
                /home/tc/.cache/dmenu_run: No such file or directory
                ^ that file is created, its a list of executables

                If you launch a GUI, terminal returns to prompt but
                for a terminal command you may need to press return
                key to get back to prompt
