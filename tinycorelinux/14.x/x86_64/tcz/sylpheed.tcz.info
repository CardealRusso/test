Comments:       Sylpheed is a graphical Email client using GTK2,
                with support for receiving with POP or IMAP, and
                sending with SMTP or an external program. It stores
                messages in MH format, but can also import and export
                in mbox and eml formats. Also supports NNTP, for use
                as a newsreader.

                Uses OpenSSL for encryption. Load gnupg.tcz for GPG
		support.
