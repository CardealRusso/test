Comments:       Do NOT choose OnBoot in Apps please.
                When ready, in Apps choose 
                DownloadOnly (not + load)
                In a terminal run
                $ tce-load -i icewm-list
                $ cat /etc/sysconfig/tcedir/icewm.lst
                Optional you can then elect to add TCEs
                to that list from your current boot list

                If you need firmware, order is important
                see your current boot list or search forum
