                $ gphoto2 --auto-detect # must show a camera or phone
                (My phone did not need usb debug enabled)

                Huawei Nova             usb:001,008
                If not, power cycle your camera until you see one.
                $ gphoto2 --get-all-files
                eg Saving file as DSCF1462.JPG
