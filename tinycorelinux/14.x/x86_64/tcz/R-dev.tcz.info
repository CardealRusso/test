Comments:       This is the R development extension
                To add more packages, please load the build essentials
                   compiletc.tcz
                   gfortran.tcz
                   R-dev.tcz
                You'll likely need extra softwares like 'bash.tcz' for the scripts.
                Or documentation tools like 'miktex.tcz' for pdflatex.
                Sometimes you'll need headers that are not covered by this extension.
                ----------
                LTO support: by default, the Link Time Optimization is turned off.
                You can enable it by switching the link to Makeconf like below:
                  sudo unlink /usr/local/lib/R/etc/Makeconf
                  sudo ln -s Makeconf.lto /usr/local/lib/R/etc/Makeconf
                The compiler flags for TC are already included in both files.
                ----------
                Installing packages:
                Please refer to the online resources for the requirements beforehand
                It's recommended to install the packages locally for TC beginners.
                Remember to append your /opt/.filetool.lst to keep the changes.
                  echo usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/packages.html >> /opt/.filetool.lst
                  filetool.sh -bv
                For advance users who would like to install globally as a tcz,
                make sure to squash up all the extra files and modify 'packages.html'
                with the tce.installed script via tools like 'patch'.
                Please refer to the Tiny Core wiki:creating_extensions.html
