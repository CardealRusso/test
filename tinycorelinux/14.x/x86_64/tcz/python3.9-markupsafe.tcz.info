Comments:       MarkupSafe implements a text object that escapes
                characters so it is safe to use in HTML and XML.
                Characters that have special meanings are replaced so that
                they display as the actual characters.
                This mitigates injection attacks, meaning untrusted user
                input can safely be displayed on a page.
                Escaping is implemented in C so it is as efficient as possible.
