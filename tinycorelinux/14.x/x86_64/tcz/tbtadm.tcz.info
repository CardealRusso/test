Comments:       Thunderbolt technology is a transformational high-speed,
                dual protocol I/O that provides unmatched performance 
                with up to 40Gbps bi-directional transfer speeds. It 
                provides flexibility and simplicity by supporting both 
                data (PCIe, USB3.1) and video (DisplayPort) on a single 
                cable connection that can daisy-chain up to six 
                devices.
                ----------
                The user-space components implement device approval support:
                Easier interaction with the kernel module for approving 
                connected devices.
                ACL for auto-approving devices white-listed by the user.
                ----------
                Binaries, scripts and docs, compiled for 11.x x86_64
Change-log:     first version 
Current:        2020/04/25 v0.9.3
