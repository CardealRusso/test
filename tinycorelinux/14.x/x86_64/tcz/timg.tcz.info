Comments:       A viewer that uses 24-Bit color capabilities and unicode
                character blocks to display images in the terminal.
                Displays regular images, plays animated gifs, scrolls
                static images and plays videos.  Very useful for if you
                want to have a quick visual check without starting a bulky
                image viewer ... and don't care about resolution.
                Requires a 24-bit-capable (truecolor) terminal emulator.
