                Troubleshooting:
                If nothing happens, here're some common solutions
                * Environment variables (VERY IMPORTANT)
                "log out" then "log in" to refresh
                 (type "exit" in prompt, then log in with "tc")
                Type "echo $XIM" in the terminal to verify (should be "ibus")
                Please refer to /etc/profile.d/ibus.sh in ibus.tcz
                * ibus-daemon didn't start
                Type "ibus engine" in terminal
                * Select Input Method
                Press <Super> + <Space> to switch between input methods
                Or run the GUI tool, ibus-setup, to change the settings
                ----------
                For more details, please refer to the documents
                Check the startup script ~/X.d/ibus-chewing and adjust for your machine
                Or copy /usr/local/share/doc/ibus-chewing/startup_script.example
                example: Add "sleep 5" at the begining of the script if X didn't start
