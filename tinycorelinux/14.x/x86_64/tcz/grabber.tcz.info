                Move the mouse with the left button depressed to draw an outline around the
                section of the screen to save. Everything inside the outline will be saved as
                a  .png  file. The outline will not be included in the saved file.

                right button depressed moves the outline.

                that will be saved. Click and drag the readout to move it if it is in your
                way, or use the v key to toggle whether it is visible or not. There is a
                setting in the config file for the default location or to disable it. It
                also has a setting for the font to use.
