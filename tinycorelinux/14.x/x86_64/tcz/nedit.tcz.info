Comments:	NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window
		System, which combines a standard, easy to use, graphical
		user interface with the thorough functionality and
		stability required by users who edit text eight hours a
		day.  It provides intensive support for development in a
		wide variety of languages, text processors, and other
		tools, but at the same time can be used productively by
		just about anyone who needs to edit text.

		Run 'ncl' (renamed from nc to avoid conflict with netcat)
		to start in client/server mode (recommended), or 'nedit'
		to start a new instance per invocation.

		Nedit uses the Motif graphics toolkit.
