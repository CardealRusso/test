                Do NOT choose OnBoot in Apps please. If you like this 
                WM then download and run icewm-list to get a icewm boot 
                list you can use with your boot loader. Then add TCEs
                This means if you change your mind onboot.lst is unpolluted!
                
                Most preferences can change via menu button or context menu. 
                Please read configs under ~/icewm. TCEs named in keyboard 
                shortcuts have no deps set except lxterminal. I am unable to 
                test on basic X so forced Xorg-7.7 (2d) as a dep. Be aware 
                that IceWM uses this order: prefoverride over theme over preferences
                
                icewmbg can control background or wallpaper(s) Or use pcmanfm 
                for another wallpaper method  https://tinyurl.com/y3ouvb94

                For all changes to a config file, or any TCE added after boot,
                that has a kb combo set.....needs WM refresh with kb combo of
                logo+r      logo = Super key
                Please input logo+r in an empty workspace for maximum safety

                optional TCEs not already mentioned include: icewm-themes
                icewm-locale..xscreensaver and read info please
                menumaker (for menu generation each time you load a new TCE) 
                I prefer it over icewm-menu-fdo              
                
                lxterminal allows apps GUI to display downloads so you do
                not need aterm in your boot list if you wish. If you wish to 
                keep wbar, recommend you edit ~/icewm/preferences 
                remove # so it reads "TaskBarAtTop=1 # 0/1"
