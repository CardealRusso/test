Comments:	Mosh is a remote terminal application that supports
		intermittent connectivity, allows roaming, and
		provides speculative local echo and line editing of
		user keystrokes.

		Requires an ssh and/or sshd for client and/or server
		usage.

		Mosh 1.4.0 is backwards-compatible with mosh-clients
		back to 0.96 and mosh-servers back to 1.0.9.

		Requires a UTF-8 locale setting (see getlocale.tcz).
