Comments:       Tested on openbox and jwm with gedit (it sometime fails with jwm)
                Before you start, add "lang=zh_CN.utf8" in your boot code (zh_TW for Traditional)
                * Download and run getlocale.tcz, select "zh_CN.utf8" and install
                * Fetch any font that support UTF-8 (ex: unifont.tcz)
                * Load this extension
                * Start a window manager
                * Switch EN/Pinyin with keyboard: <Shift>
                You should be able to use pinyin now, enjoy ~ !
                ----------
                Troubleshooting:
                If nothing happens, here're some common solutions
                * Environment variables (VERY IMPORTANT)
                "log out" then "log in" to refresh
                 (type "exit" in prompt, then log in with "tc")
                Type "echo $XIM" in the terminal to verify (should be "ibus")
                Please refer to /etc/profile.d/ibus.sh in ibus.tcz
                * ibus-daemon didn't start
                Type "ibus engine" in terminal
                * Select Input Method
                Press <Super> + <Space> to switch between input methods
                Or run the GUI tool, ibus-setup, to change the settings
                ----------
                For more details, please refer to the documents
                Check the startup script ~/X.d/ibus-chewing and adjust for your machine
                Or copy /usr/local/share/doc/ibus-chewing/startup_script.example
                example: Add "sleep 5" at the begining of the script if X didn't start
                ----------
                Maintainer note:
                I don't use pinyin.
                If anyone is interested in maintaining the packages.
                Feel free to take over.
