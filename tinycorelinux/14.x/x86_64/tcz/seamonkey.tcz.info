Comments:       The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop the 
		SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite (see below). Such a 
		software suite was previously made popular by Netscape and 
		Mozilla, and the SeaMonkey project continues to develop and 
		deliver high-quality updates to this concept. Containing an 
		Internet browser, email & newsgroup client with an included 
		web feed reader, HTML editor, IRC chat and web development 
		tools, SeaMonkey is sure to appeal to advanced users, web 
		developers and corporate users.
		Under the hood, SeaMonkey uses much of the same Mozilla Firefox 
		source code which powers such products as Thunderbird. Legal 
		backing is provided by the SeaMonkey Association (SeaMonkey e.V.).
