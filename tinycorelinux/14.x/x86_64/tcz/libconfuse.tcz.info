Comments:       libConfuse is a configuration file parser library written
                in C. It supports sections and (lists of) values, as well
                as other features such as single/double quoted strings,
                environment variable expansion, functions and nested include
                statements. Values can be strings, integers, floats,
                booleans, and sections.
