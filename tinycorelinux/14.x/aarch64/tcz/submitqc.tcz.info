Comments:       submitqc is used to audit extensions before submission.
                Run the script in the same directory as the extensions
                you want to check. The script will report any issues
                with the structure, formatting, etc. Where possible,
                simple errors will be fixed.

                Results are echoed to the terminal and logged at
                /tmp/submitqc

                The original script was written by Jason W. Various
                updates and changes have been made over the years by
                gordonselfish, coreplayer2, dentonlt, and others.
