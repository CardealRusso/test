Comments:       Screensavers, some support setuid. Can optionally 
                lock your screen if pw set. System config at 
                /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver
                is over ridden by home config.
                    
                Mode 1 without a password= screen savers 
                Mode 2 if password set allows screen, once locked,
                to open only with correct password. Please make changes 
                at mode 1 first, so you have a home config.
                
                It is normal for the screen to fade to darkness. Before 
                darkness you can click an input device to stop the process.
                    
                1) Mode 1 has no login password so no lock so you 
                untick the lock box please. Run 
                $ xscreensaver-demo
                Greyed out screensavers are either opengl ones which have 
                not been compiled or glitchy screensavers I removed.
                Popup will ask to start daemon -> select Yes. 
                Choose your preferences, file is saved to
                ~/.xscreensaver Click on preview to see effects. 
                Click any kb key or mouse to stop demo.
                                        
                If after test you like it, autostart with
                echo 'xscreensaver -nosplash &' > ~/.X.d/xscreensaver
                (Above equals start the daemon)
                Optional, add that line to an existing ~/.X.d file
                ->
                $ exittc (or GUI) and exit to prompt and run
                $ startx
                Do not move mouse or kb clicks for the time you set to test.
                If you have also set rotation of screens, you then need to wait
                even longer for at least one rotation to occur.
                    
                2) Mode 2 -> After setting screensaver preferences, 
                run $ sudo passwd tc 
                to setup a password for local user. Consider persistence 
                of your password by backing up /etc/shadow
                Do not move mouse or kb clicks for the time you set to test.
                Click mouse or kb -> password dialog box appears.
                
                3) Faster mode 2 lock -> run the command
                $ lockx
                
                Some window managers have their own key combo files too
