Comments:       from a shell prompt run "get-chromium-latest.sh"

                Proceed at your own risk, script attempts to
                download a debian browser and its codec package
                -> create TCE & inject it into your TCEDIR

                You will need over 500MB of free ram or free space
                to download and build package. The final extension is about
                150MB

                When script has finished and you have loaded TCE,
                wbar icon should launch or try terminal command
                $ chromium-browser

                Example startup scripts in /usr/local/share/get-chromium-browser/files
