Comments:	SoX (Sound eXchange) is the Swiss Army knife of
		sound processing tools: it can convert sound files
		between many different file formats & audio devices,
		and can apply many sound effects & transformations,
		as well as doing basic analysis and providing input
		to more capable analysis and plotting tools.
