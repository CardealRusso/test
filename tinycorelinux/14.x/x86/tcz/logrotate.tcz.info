Comments:       The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration
                of log files on a system which generates a lot of log files. Logrotate
                allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing
                of log files. Logrotate can be set to handle a log file hourly, daily, weekly,
                monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.

                After configuration, logrotate should be run on a schedule e.g. using crontab
                which can be setup to run daily, or even hourly if faster rotation is required.

                Install logrotate-doc.tcz for configuration examples.
