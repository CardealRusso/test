Comments: ----------
  - The script takes no arguments. To start it with default
    settings, simply do: $ simple-screensaver &
  - The script has only five settings (see the "load_config" function), which 
    you can override if you create ~/.config/simple-screensaver.conf
  - Here is an example simple-screensaver.conf:
idle=180 # seconds to wait before starting animation
cycle=60 # seconds to wait before switching animation
animation_dir=/usr/local/share/simple-screensaver/animations
command_file=/usr/local/share/simple-screensaver/animation_commands.txt
photo_dir=$HOME/Photos/Fiji_vacation
  - Your config file may have fewer than five lines--you only need to specify
    settings you wish to change from the default
  - Your config file takes effect immediately, no need to restart the script
  - If you remove a line from your config file, that setting immediately reverts 
    to default
  - If you delete your config file, all settings immediately revert to default
  - Use "cycle=0" if you don't want animation to change once it starts
  - Keep a single line in command_file if you want a specific animation instead
    of a random one
  - Caveat: Your window manager needs to be EWMH/NetWM-compatible in order for 
    the script to work as intended; ultra-minimalistic window managers such as 
    flwm are not compatible (see http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl)
  - Note: The 3d animations don't work ("Segmentation fault") if Xorg-7.7-3d.tcz
    (one of this extension's dependencies) is loaded after your X session is 
    already running. To avoid this issue, do "tce-load -wi simple-screensaver"
    then reboot. With simple-screensaver.tcz now in your tce/onboot.lst, all
    our dependencies (including Xorg-7.7-3d.tcz) are loaded before the X session
    starts, problem solved!
