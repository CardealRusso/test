Comments:       Protobuf-c is a C implementation of the Google Protocol
                Buffers data serialization format. It includes libprotobuf-c, a
                pure C library that implements protobuf encoding and decoding,
                and protoc-c, a code generator that converts Protocol Buffer
                .proto files to C descriptor code, based on the original protoc.

                protobuf-c formerly included an RPC implementation;
                that code has been split out into the protobuf-c-rpc project.
