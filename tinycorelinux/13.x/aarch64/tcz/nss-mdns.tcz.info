Comments:       nss-mdns is a plugin providing host name resolution via Multicast DNS 
                (aka Zeroconf, aka Apple Rendezvous, aka Apple Bonjour) nss-mdns provides 
                client functionality only, which means that you have to run avahi if you 
                want to register the local host name via mDNS.

                compiled to know avahi socket is non-standard under /run not /var/run
                
                nss-mdns tries to contact a running avahi-daemon for resolving host names and 
                addresses and making use of its superior record cacheing. Instructions

                Especially: If you run a firewall, do not forget to allow UDP traffic to the 
                mDNS multicast address 224.0.0.251 on port 5353.
