Comments:       sane created before LGPL created.
                some of the (original) backend authors cannot 
                be contacted any longer, for various reasons, 
                not to mention each and every contributor who 
                sent in a patch. This effectively makes it 
                impossible for the SANE Project to relicense SANE

                Most can be GPL v2
