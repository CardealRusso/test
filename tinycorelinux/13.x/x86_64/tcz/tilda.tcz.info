Comments:       Tilda is a terminal emulator and can be compared with other
                popular terminal emulators such as gnome-terminal (Gnome),
                Konsole (KDE), xterm and many others. The specialities of
                Tilda are that it does not behave like a normal window but
                instead it can be pulled up and down from the top of the
                screen with a special hotkey. Additionally Tilda is highly
                configurable. It is possible to configure the hotkeys for
                keybindings, change the appearance and many options that
                affect the behavior of Tilda.
