Comments:       Do NOT choose OnBoot in Apps please.
                Do not download this TCE unless you 
                have tested icewm and am happy to 
                have a boot loader list file to 
                automate the booting of IceWM.

                When ready, in Apps choose 
                DownloadOnly (not + load)
                In a terminal run
                $ tce-load -i icewm-list
                $ cat /etc/sysconfig/tcedir/icewm.lst
                Optional you can then elect to add TCEs
                to that list from your current list
                (Maybe from onboot.lst?)

                If you need firmware, order is important
                see your current boot list or refer to forum
