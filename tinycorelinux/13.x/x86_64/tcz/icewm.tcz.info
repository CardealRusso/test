Comments:       Do NOT choose OnBoot in Apps please.
                If you like this WM then download and run
                icewm-list to get a icewm boot list you can
                use with your boot loader. Then add your other TCEs
                
                Most preferences, use the menu button or 
                context menu to change please. 
                 
                Please READ/edit your configs under ~/icewm
                Toolbar (and keys) has sakuara TCE set 
                sakura.tcz (forced dep as xterm set)
                pcmanfm.tcz (recommended TCE)
                geany.tcz (recommended TCE)
                keys names kb combos but only sakura is a dep
                (Means you need to load the others or add to boot list 
                to be effective)
                
                Feel free to edit YOUR configs. I am unable to test on 
                basic X so forced Xorg-7.7 (2d) as a dep.
                            
                Be aware that IceWM uses this order: 
                prefoverride over theme over preferences
                
                icewmbg can control background or wallpaper(s)
                See pcmanfm for a conflicting wallpaper method

                After any change to a config file, any TCE added after boot,
                that has a kb combo set.....needs WM refresh with kb combo of
                Super+r = logo+r

                optional TCEs not already mentioned include: 
                icewm-themes (CrystalBlue is new default)
                icewm-help (stripped from main TCE)
                icewm-doc (man pages)
                icewm-locale 
                xscreensaver (and set local and root pw please)
                ( This evades lock workstation setting )
                
                Do NOT try logout/shutdown buttons after using 
                Ctrl+Alt+Del keys. Or any other non-exittc method.
                YOUR SYSTEM  WILL FREEZE!
