Comments:	----------
		- firefox.profile and chromium-browser.profile are tested and working in TCL 11.x
		- usage examples:
		    $ firejail firefox
		    $ firejail chromium-browser
		- sound in sandboxed chromium-browser worked for me out of the box
		- sound in sandboxed firefox may require commenting-out this line in /usr/local/etc/firejail/firefox-common.profile:
		    seccomp !chroot
		- profiles other than the two above are untested and will likely need adjustments
		    (see this thread: http://forum.tinycorelinux.net/index.php/topic,23557.0.html)
