                MUST be on Xorg (2d or 3d). 
                Click Outputs < HDMI* or DVI*> 
                -> Resolution -> Choose your preference  
                -> Click the Tick button 
                I am unable to test 2 monitors but recommend
                you tick the primary radio button.
                
                If you wish to save new setting -> Click the 
                download icon and choose a filename maybe 1920
                (.sh is added by the TCE and created at 
                ~/.screenlayout/1920.sh)
                
                To automate it -> (change file-name below)
                echo '.screenlayout/1920.sh &' > ~./X.d/monitor
                
                My choices were limited under Xorg 2d versus 3d 
                I suggest use a WM that has window decorations  
                if you go from high to low numbers, so you can 
                re-position to get to some buttons. YMMV
