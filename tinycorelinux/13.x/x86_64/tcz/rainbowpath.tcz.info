Comments:       rainbowpath is a program for making paths pretty. It can
                be used to make pretty shell prompts. rainbowpath formats
                supplied path by coloring each path component with a color
                selected from a palette. By default, colors for path
                components are selected based on the order they appear in
                the palette. If no palette is supplied a default one will
                be used. 
                See rainbowpath-doc.tcz for PS1 prompt suggestions.
