Comments:       Tcpreplay is a suite of GPLv3 licensed utilities for editing and
                finally replay the traffic back onto the network and through other devices
                such as switches, routers, firewalls, NIDS and IPS's. Tcpreplay supports
                both single and dual NIC modes for testing both sniffing and in-line devices.

                The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
                If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-netfilter-x.x.x-tinycore.tcz via
                the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-netfilter-KERNEL).
