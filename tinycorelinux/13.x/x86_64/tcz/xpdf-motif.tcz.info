Comments:	PDF viewer for X using the Motif toolkit. This is
		the last version before the project switched to the
		(larger) qt toolkit.

		See the xpopple-xpdf.tcz extension for another
		version which uses the same Motif interface and
		the more up-to-date Poppler PDF rendering library.
		This version is included because the total size
		including dependencies is a bit smaller than xpopple.

		Note that docs are included in this extension
		because the README states that this is required by 
		the author.
