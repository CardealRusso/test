Comments:       XML::SAX::Base
                This module has a very simple task - to be a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.
                It's default behaviour is to pass the input directly to the output unchanged.
                It can be useful to use this module as a base class so you don't have to, 
                for example, implement the characters() callback.
