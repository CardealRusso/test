Comments:       Leftovers from the linux-firmware not large 
                enough to have their own TCE.
  
                firmware.tcz was created in 2011 and split by 
                coreplayer2 into various TCEs at later dates. 
                This is another split.
Change-log:     2020/06/20 split from firmware.tcz and updated
Current:        2020/06/20
