Comments:       This script is dependent on  binutils.tcz and squashfstools.tcz
                There are options to specify the java install path and the
                java installation archive path. Additionally, the legal documents
                are separated into their own TCZ package and an md5sum file will
                be generated for both. All final output files are placed in
                either the TCE/optional folder, if install selected, or the
                users home directory.
                The resulting Java TCZ file is created to install to /usr/local, /opt
                or the specified target directory.
                Tested against Java 8u16x, 9.0.x and 10, ix86 and x86_64 bit, jdk, jre and
                serverjre tarballs.
                User must manually download the tarball from Oracle at
                http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
                The tarball checksum in optional, but the script can retrieve it
                from Oracle if 'fetch' entered for checksum.
                The plugin is not configured for web browsers, as it did not
                work correctly when it was configured for either Firefox or Opera.
                It is recommended that the mkjavapkg.tcz be installed as
                on-demand.
Change-log:     Improved error handling, adding ability to fetch tarball checksum
                from Oracle.
Current:        2018/04/04 for Tiny Core 4.8.x
