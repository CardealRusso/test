Comments:       ncclient is a Python library that facilitates client-side scripting and application
                development around the NETCONF protocol.
                It aims to offer an intuitive API that sensibly maps the XML-encoded nature of NETCONF
                to Python constructs and idioms, and make writing network-management scripts easier.
