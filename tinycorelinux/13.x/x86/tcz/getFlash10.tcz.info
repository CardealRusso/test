		Downloads from Adobe.
                Extracts linux libflashplayer.so
                Setup libflashplayer for either Minefield, Firefox, Opera, 
		Seamonkey or all four. Also includes compiled libflashsupport.so 
		for OSS sound. libflashsupport is licensed under Creative 
		Commons Attribution 3.0.
		Added newly compiled libflashsupport.so with Alsa & pulseaudio support.
		System installed sound modules (OSS or ALSA) will be dectected on
		initial run, required libflashsupport.so for system will then 
		be installed to flash10 extension.
		NOTE: Re-run this extension/script if sound modules are changed,
		to include system specific libflashsupport module.

                Finally packages a flash10.tcz to add to your tcz collection.
.
                NOTE:  Upon first time loading of this extension, the getflash10.sh
		script is automatically run.
.
                If you already have your tce directory setup, then a flash10.tcz
                will be installed there, otherwise it is in /tmp/tce/.  flash10.tcz
		will be loaded upon completion of the getflash script.
.
                CAUTION: Flash10 requires gtk2 which is quite large.
		
		This extension is PPI compatible.
