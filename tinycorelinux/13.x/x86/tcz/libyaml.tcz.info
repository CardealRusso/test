Comments:       LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter library
                LibYAML covers presenting and parsing processes.
                Thus LibYAML defines the following two processors:
                - Parser, which takes an input stream of bytes and
                produces a sequence of parsing events.
                - Emitter, which takes a sequence of events and
                produces a stream of bytes.
