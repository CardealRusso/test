Comments:       A regular expression library for python that extends the
                built-in functionality.  It claims to be i686, but was
                compiled with tinycore's default python compiler arguments:
                -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -O3 -pipe
Change-log:     2017/09/26 Compiled from source for tinycore 8.x
Current:        2017/09/26 Compiled from source for tinycore 8.x
