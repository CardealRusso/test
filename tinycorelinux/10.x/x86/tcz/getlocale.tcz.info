Tags:	    Script build customized locale support
Comments:       To avoid having one huge locale support extension, this 
		script builds a customized one according to your 
		selections.
-
		If you load this in the console, the script is called 
		getlocale.sh.
-
		The new extension will be called mylocale.tcz.
-
		For gtk2/3 apps, you may need to set
		G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@locale
		in your profile/bashrc (/etc/profile sets it to iso8859-1)
