Comments:       The latest watcher, now available as an extension.
		1.10.1:
		- Removed 2 error messages because they were not errors yet. Rich
		1.10:
		- A patch to check for energy as well as charge was applied
		- on Sept 1, 2017 but never recompiled. Rich
		Changes from 1.8.1:
		- Support for more meminfo formats, FLTK 1.3 rebuild
		1.8:
		- WM border fix
		1.7:
		- updated battery support for linux 3.0
		1.6:
		- battery support
		- no borders (looking better on non-swallowing WMs)
-
		Use the X standard -g option to position watcher where-ever
		wanted. X counts from top-left, so watcher in top-left corner:
		watcher -g +0+0
		Top-right would be "-0+0", bottom left "+0-0", bottom right
		"-0-0".
-
		To start watcher on X start, add to .xsession:
		[ $(which watcher) ] && watcher -g +0-0 &
-
		For more options, run  watcher -h
-
		This extension is PPI compatible.
