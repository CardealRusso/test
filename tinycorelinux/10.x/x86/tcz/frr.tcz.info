Comments:	Frr is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based
		routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1,
		RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.
		Frr also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.
		In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Frr also supports
		IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and
		AgentX protocol, Frr provides routing protocol MIBs.
		
		The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
		If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-4.x.x-tinycore.tcz via
		the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-KERNEL).

		A startup script is included at /usr/local/etc/init.d/frr.
		To use this script cp /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons.sample to /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons.
		Configure the daemons you want to start with yes or a priority.
		Use the script with "sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/frr" <options>.
		This script also includes a reload option, to reload a configuration file.
		The reload option requires python-ipaddr.tcz to be intalled 
		(tce-load -wi python-ipaddr.tcz).

                The install script can help to do the basic setup of FRR.
                By default it will setup FRR to use vtysh (one configuration for all daemons).
                If you don't want the install script to do the basic setup for you,
                you can disable it with creating a file NOSETUPHELP in /tmp 
                (touch /tmp/NOSETUPHELP) before installation.

		Watchfrr, a daemon monitoring connectivity with routing daemons,
		is now enabled by default. This can be disabled via /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons.
