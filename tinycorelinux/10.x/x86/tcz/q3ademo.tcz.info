Comments:       Quake 3 Arena Demo for Linux (i386) - includes 4 maps,
                6 different player characters and bots. Quake 3 Arena
                requires a supported 3D accelerator. 
                ----
                To play this game you need OpenGL driver for 3D graphic (Voodoo 1 is also supported).
                aoss and alsa are also required for sound but the game can work without it.
                Run with: sudo aoss q3demo
