Comments:       Quagga is a routing software suite, providing
                implementations of OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIP v1 and v2,
                RIPng and BGP-4 for Unix platforms, particularly FreeBSD,
                Linux, Solaris and NetBSD. Quagga is a fork of GNU Zebra
                which was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro.

                The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
                If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-4.8.17-tinycore.tcz via
                the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-KERNEL).
