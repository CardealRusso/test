Comments:       Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes
                your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts
                or custom code to deploy and update your applications - automate 
                in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents
                to install on remote systems.
