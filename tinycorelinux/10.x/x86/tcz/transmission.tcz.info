Comments:       Uses less CPU than any other GUI clients and some non-GUI client
                Lowest memory footprint of any major BitTorrent client.
                Share files with using CLI and/or web-browser interfaces.
                Local and remote management.
                Tested with Icecat. For example:
                1. ln -s /mnt/sdb1/Downloads ~/Downloads [see Note 1]
                2. Start transmission-daemon
                3. Browser http://127.0.0.1:9091/transmission/web/
                   Allow scripts on page.
                4. Paste in magnet link. Got book in 28 seconds.
                Note 1:
                 Add link (or maybe you made a mount point) to
                 /opt/.xfiletool.lst to for quick TC loading.
                Missing: copy or export magnet link from torrent.
                We can still make magnet links to send to friends
                and post in forums. I have included a simple
                tool, magnet_trans, for you.
