Comments:       The Oxygen typeface family is created as part of the 
                KDE Project, a libre desktop for the GNU+Linux 
                operating system. The design is optimised for 
                the FreeType font rendering system and works well 
                in all graphical user interfaces, desktops and devices.

                This is a web font version of Oxygen, designed to be 
                used freely across the internet by web browsers on 
                desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

                Oxygen is a Unicode typeface family that supports 
                languages that use the Latin script and its variants              
                
                If your App is open when you load this package, please close it 
                and on restart, the fonts should be available. Tested on leafpad
