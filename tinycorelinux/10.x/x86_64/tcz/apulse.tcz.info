Comments:	-----
	- This is a minimalistic, partial implementation of the pulseaudio API
	- For users who don't want pulseaudio but use an application that requires it (e.g., recent firefox)
	- With this extension loaded, applications that can use alsa will continue to use alsa
	- Usage: Launch the pulseaudio-requiring application using the apulse wrapper script, like so:
	   $ apulse firefox
