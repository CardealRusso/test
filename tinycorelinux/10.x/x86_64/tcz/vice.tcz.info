Comments:       WARNING downloading ROMs may be illegal

                FIRST set up and test sound works for pulseaudio as per its info
                I used both US kb and logitech gamepad F310 in testing.
                No claims made about any being any good.

                App stripped to c64 emulators, all others in vice-others.tcz

                It is important to read most of the docs in the docs TCE please.
                Any reference to 
                /usr/local/lib64/vice/doc is to be READ as
                /usr/local/share/doc/vice-doc/
                So in GUI you can not open the manual in the help pulldown
                Instead load doc and point web browser to index.html
           
                Suggest you mkdir ROMs with local powers and add roms there. 
                Use GUI to attach ROM by navigating to it.

                Quick guide to using T(ape) or D(isk) image ROMs see
                http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/vice_5.html

                C64 keymap is /usr/local/lib64/vice/C64/gtk3_sym.vkm
                --- for keyboard users

                HINTS----C key is likely to be left Ctrl
                Run/stop key likely to be Esc 
                Space bar may likely have effects too
                Some games expect controller in number 2 position
                Do you see green light on "applet controller" when "direction" pressed?
                Do you see red light in middle of applet controller when you fire?
                applet controller = tiny representations in GUI at bottom.

                Note that you MAY need to change your vicerc file
                to other pathways...from C64 to (eg) C128 etc
                --if you can see that loading of a non-c64 emulator fails

                Compiled for 10.x
