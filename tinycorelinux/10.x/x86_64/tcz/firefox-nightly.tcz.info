Comments:	----------
		This is a nightly build of the Mozilla (Firefox) web
		browser.
		For the complete list of build options, open the browser
		and visit the URL "about:".
		This build disables gstreamer, gio, and some other
		features. Firefox requires versions of these (and other
		libraries) that are not yet available in the x86_64
		respository.
		This browser works with the final Linux release of Adobe
		Flash.
