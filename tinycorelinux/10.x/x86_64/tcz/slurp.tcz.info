Comments:       Can only be used on sway.  slurp is a command-line app to 
                select a region inside sway and used with grim to take a screenshot.
                grim can not escape its current window, but slurp can.

                $ slurp | grim 1.png

                hold mouse button down....move mouse to bottom RH corner of selection.
                Release button.....screenshot taken)
