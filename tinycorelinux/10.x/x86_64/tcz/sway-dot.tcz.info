Comments:       startx is used to start a libX or Xorg DE or WM
                sway runs on Wayland so to allow people to try sway
                I have elected to give them a dot local bin file called
                z.....to use at the exit at prompt to launch sway

                See sway info on how to exit sway and then you can run
                startx to start your preferred DE/WM if you do not like sway.

                That means this app is a download ONLY and not to be added to 
                your boot list file. It is run ONLY once by 
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot
      
                Compiled for 10.x
