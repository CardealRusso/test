                In order to use it, cddb needs online access 
                There is a short delay for info to populate the GUI

                Quick Tips 
                extra TCEs can be loaded with asunder already running
                untick any tracks before Preferences and choosing
                format:
                --wav already supported
                --mp3 needs lame.tcz
                --ogg needs vorbis-tools .tcz
                --flac needs flac.tcz (loaded by vorbis-tools too)
                --wavpack needs wavpack.tcz
                I suggest you until M3U playlist under preferences too
                Now its safe to click that RIP button
                RESULTS are under each artist Dir.
