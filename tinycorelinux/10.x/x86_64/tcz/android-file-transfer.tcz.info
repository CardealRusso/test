Comments:       One method of transferring files from/to Android/PC
                Does not use udev/rules  Access internal storage or sdcard,
                no access to System Files to root device etc
 
                If you are happy with gmtp/gvfs/mtpfs or any other 
                mtp software, you might not need this TCE 
                
                See the website (or doc TCE) for known problems, 
                eg samsung phones are read only. 

                Android Instructions 
                Enable USB debugging 
                System settings -> about phone
                TAP "build number" 7 times to enable developer mode
                Go into new dir and turn on usb debugging

                Next, data cable is connected PC to a live phone
                Enable file transfer (default is charging)
                ---on most androids, its a pull down notification.
                Some recent Androids may ask if you trust the attached PC
                
                PC Instructions, vary depending on your home persistance,
                $ mkdir ~/Android  # if no persistence
                $ aft-mtp-mount ~/Android
                ( You may see a ignorable error as per below)
                
                Navigate using your file manager or terminal to Android dir
                and copy/paste or "whatever" you need to do

                Ignoreable error suggests phone is NOT mounted when it is!
