Comments:       xfce window manager. 

                 Before doing any download or reboot into xfce please
                 edit /opt/shutdown.sh and add the following line to bottom 
                 of script. changing  tc to whatever your login name is.
                                  rm -rf /home/tc/.xsession

                 This allows you to reboot into another WM/DE because
                 if you do not like xfce we do not want your .xsession file
                 to have the xfce stuff in it. When you boot up bootloader 
                 choosing xfce.lst, .xsession file changes to a compatible xfce one
                 Remember to exit using exittc please
                
                If you wish to try out XFCE, please follow these steps
                In APPS choose download rather than onboot. 
                               ###########################

                In Apps download xfwm4 and xfwm4-list ( APPS will also 
                download lots of dependencies as XFCE is not a light 
                window manager)

                The main reason for the below steps is if you do not 
                like XFCE, you have not corrupted your current 
                boot list, likely to be onboot.lst. So if you find any 
                gremlins simply use the exit menu or if that is not 
                working, press your hardware reboot button and reboot 
                into your preferred window manager.  Leaping ahead, my 
                list is small. On boot up to XFCE, you can use Apps ->
                Maintenance -> Onboard Maintenance to add in your fav apps.
                (APPS is smart to alter only the current boot-list file!!!)
                
                2. After download of those 2 TCZs, in a terminal
                $ tce-load -i xfwm4-list
                This will create xfce.lst into your tcedir. Note it is
                xfce.lst for list not xfce.1st Please check its there 
                before reboot! The xfwm4-list TCZ is designed to be run once,
                while the main or doc etc can be run multiple times.

                3. Reboot into your bootloader
                If you have xbase.lst entry, manually change 
                that entry from xbase.lst to xfce.lst
                and use your bootloader to boot
                (For grub2 users press F10)
                
                If you have no list showing in bootloader 
                menu, edit your bootloader menu manually,
                find the line that included tce=sd(etc)
                add this extra bit
                lst=xfce.lst 
                and then boot with that amended entry.

                If your bootloader menu is missing tce=(etc)
                add lst=xfce.lst to whatever is your kernel
                line for grub/2 
                OR for APPEND line for syslinux.cfg

                If in doubt seek help in the forum.

                4. If after testing, you like XFCE seek help
                on how to add a new entry. I use another 
                distro grub2 to boot into TC

                5. Newbies should not delete any entry for xfce.lst
                without forum or email help. However, if you have
                intel graphics do not  delete graphics-KERNEL.tcz 
                
                My build no longer uses /etc/sysconfig/desktop
                If you wish to check you are on XFCE the 
                correct command to run is
                $ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
                (expected result=XFCE)
