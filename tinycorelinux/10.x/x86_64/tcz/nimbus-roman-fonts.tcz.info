Comments:       Full name=Nimbus Roman No 9 L is a serif typeface created by 
                URW Studio in 1987, and eventually released under the GPL. 
                It features Normal, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic weights, 
                and is one of several freely licensed fonts offered by URW++.

                Although the characters are not exactly the same, 
                Nimbus Roman No 9 L has metrics almost identical to Times 
                and Times New Roman. It is one of the Ghostscript fonts, 
                a free alternative to 35 basic PostScript fonts (which include Times).

                In the past, it was used as default font in OpenOffice.org Writer in some 
                Linux distributions but "they" may have changed to Liberation Serif.
                OpenOffice now called libreoffice               
                
                If your App is open when you load this package, 
                please close it and on restart, the fonts 
                should be available. Tested on leafpad.       

                Compiled for 64 9.x
