Comments:       The Liberation(tm) Fonts is a font family 
                which aims at metric compatibility with 
                Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New. 
                It is sponsored by Red Hat 

                This package does not include
                Liberation Sans Narrow font due 
                to licensing problems. 

                If your App is open when you load this 
                package, please close your editor and 
                on your App restart, the fonts should 
                be available.
