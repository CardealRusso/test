                Steps
                #####
                Run a window manager with Xorg please.

                $ tce-load -i arandr
                wbar -> arandr or $ arandr
                GUI should show < name of connection >,
                -------I see HDMI-2, but I am on DVI cable.
                other choices for me, DP-1 and other HDMIs

                Ouputs -> < name of your connection>
                -> Resolution -> Choice your numbers eg 800x600 
                -> Click the Apply button 
                (expect Monitor to go black for a couple of seconds)
                And then new resolution should occur
               
                If instead of size you wish to rotate, instead of 
                Resolution choose Orientation. On my PC, 
                rotate left...rotates clockwise and no need 
                to click apply for rotation.

                I am unable to test 2 monitors and Primary was
                unticked. YMMV
