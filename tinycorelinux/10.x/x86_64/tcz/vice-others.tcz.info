Comments:       vice is the main package and has the c64* 
                emulators. This App contains the others but depends 
                on vice for essential files.

                Note that you MAY need to change your vicerc file
                to other pathways...from C64 to (eg) C128 etc
                --if you can see that loading of a non-c64 emulator fails

                Please read vice and its doc

                Compiled for 10.x
