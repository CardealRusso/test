Comments:       Sound with no support for Alsa nor pulseaudio
                Unable to test on my new hardware. Refer to the wiki
                Install script will start OSS then run $ossinfo to see if 
                any audio devices are found.  (=sound out devices)

                If you load any usb device, after loading TCE then restart OSS by
                $ sudo soundoff && sudo soundon

                To see which devices are supported see devices.list 
             
                Optional dep is GUI mixer called OSS-mixer.tcz
                ###########  ossmix or ossxmix may show sound muted by default
                libvorbis.tcz might offer ogg support but unable to test

                Persistence files use control panel to add any that you need please
                #############
                1) if you run $sudo savemixer ---file to backup will be 
                           usr/lib/oss/etc/mixer.state
                2) For Dir=usr/lib/oss/etc save 3 files if found they are:
                     installed_drivers legacy_devices userdefs
                3) If you change any config under usr/lib/oss/etc/conf/
                        backup the entire dir please, due to the my poor 
                        design of tce.installed which re-creates entire dir.
                 So your backup would be usr/lib/oss/etc/conf
