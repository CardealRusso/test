                (Load usb-utils if you wish to run $lsusb to get usb ids)

                I prefer wicd to obtain wifi.
                                
                After usb dongle is inserted I run
                $ tce-load -i 8188eu
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus start
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/wicd start

                Click on the wicd icon, and assuming you see your router 
                name, click on properties and pulldown and choose WPA 1/2 
                (PASSPHRASE) assuming you use wpa2, input your passphrase 
                then click Ok. Next click connect.

                Optional--Top right corner is a triangle pointing down symbol
                - Preferences -> advanced settings you may like to click 
                dBm to get dBm instead of % connection strength?
                I prefer to un-tick show never connections. YMMV 

                If your device works for you, consider reading wicd info 
                on adding some stuff to your backup, and adding this TCZ
                to your current boot list.

                Good Luck Testing
