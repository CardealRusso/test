Comments:       terminal software to read man pages eg
                $ man <man-page-name>
 
                WARNING setting setuid for user=man has not been compiled so 
                $ mandb -t (and some others) will fail. Most people will only
                want to read man pages and not create them here. IMHO
               
                Compiled for 10.x
