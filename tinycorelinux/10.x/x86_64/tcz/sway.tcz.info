Comments:       You must NOT load sway on a libX or Xorg desktop as 
                your desktop will crash...... Online wiki is here
                https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki
                Note the wiki also mentions polkit matters. I have US keyboard,  
                read the sway-doc for other inputs please.

                This wayland compositor might suit members who do not mind 
                reading the config and using keyboard combinations (kb combos) 
                to launch their fav apps. Kb combos tend to be faster than mouse, 
                but you may need a mouse.

                If you change .config/sway/config,  run from within sway
                $ sway -C (to check its correct)

                FIRST TIME USE
                ###############
                Download this App and sway-dot, then run sway-dot
                to create a dot local bin file called z -which you can edit if needed.
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot  

                VIDEO DRIVER?
                #############
                Closed source drivers are not supported by sway. 
                 
                How to start Sway
                ###########
                Exit to prompt  and run
                $  z                 

                Running Sway
                ############
                config has list of current kb combos and other info
                You can change the main modifier key--Note the capitals where applicable
                logo key = Mod4  (our default and defined elsewhere as $mod)
                Alt key = Mod1
                Ctrl key = Control 
                Shift key = Shift 

                Create and move to new workspace (WS) by (eg) logo + 2 (or some other number)
                (The + sign means you hold down the logo key and press 2)

                Open a terminal by logo + Enter. One has been auto started on WS 1
                Repeating logo and enter will tile second terminal....and so on etc.
                Tiling occurs for all apps too if you duplicate the kb combos.

                Except when dmenu/bemenu (optional deps) are active, your active app
                has a bold title bar. Start dmenu by logo + d
               
                Quit active App (executable) by (config shows it as focused window)
                logo + shift + q

                Exitting sway----- to get back to X(org) DE/WM 
                #############
                logo + Shift + e 
                Use mouse to click correct button
                $ startx

                If you do not need a mouse, edit your home config line so it reads
                bindsym $mod+Shift+e exec swaymsg exit

                Optional dependencies

                grim and slurp (take screenshots)
                dmenu  ( a launcher must have xwayland loaded and enabled)
                bemenu and j4-dmenu-desktop (can run with xwayland disabled)
                wl-clipboard (terminal clipboard manager)
                wf-recorder (screen recorder--no sound)
                
                quick guide to change resolution and speed
                ######################################
                $ swaymsg -t get_outputs
                (look at output  ---mine defaults to highest  resolution @ 60Hz
                and modify the config file with my example showing)
                output HDMI-A-2 mode 1280x1024@75Hz
                (exit sway and re-start it then repeat get outputs command)

                ########
                Tray icon support has been disabled this build. 
                Bottom of file has some non-standard configs below the ###s
                # xwayland disable  
                exec lxterminal
                exec apps

                ^^ remove the comment if you are confident using commands
                to maintain your system without FLTK GUIs
              
                You can launch more apps on WS 1 INSTEAD of creating keybindings
                and then use "move" kb combos to move them to preferred WS numbers 
                eg I use a specific workspace for local terminal, another for web browser etc
                Remember your "move" kb combo actions the ACTIVE titlebar app

                Alternatively try at WS 1....use kb combo to -- create and move -- to workspace 2 
                = logo +2 ...use config "created" kb keybinding  to launch your fav app
                repeat to create and move to workspace 3...etc.etc
                IMHO my first way is faster. 

                I recommend you remove wbar and add sway then reboot to test sway.
                Otherwise you will need to kill wbar if you load a new package on sway.
                Remember sway will not auto launch over reboot, it needs to exit to prompt 
                and run z command.
