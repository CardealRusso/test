Comments:       Thanks to tc-dev team for use of screenshot.sh source which
		is used in this script.
		The primary function of this small script based tool
		called "snap2usb" is to save desktop snapshots directly to
		USB drives (usb_device/snapshots/) directory.
		Simply select the wbar camera icon to have a snapshot saved
		in your usb device's snapshots/ directory.
		In the event a USB drive is not found (eg: booted from a cd) then
		a snapshots directory will created in the users home directory
		and the snapshots will be saved there.
