Comments:	Extension integrity check  

			A utility for verifying the integrety of each installed 
			extension, then auto updates any which fail.  
			Provides a mechanism for the protection of user modified extensions,
			protected extensions will not be processed, updated or removed.
			Resolves missing *./tcz.md5.txt files and updates as required,
			unless protected.
			Default mode verifies against md5.db from respective repo
			Creates a backup of updated tcz's to safegaurd against inadvertent deletion 
			yet includes a method to clean up previously backed up extensions.

			Use
			tce-md5check    	from the desktop menu option, or from command line.
			tce-md5check -h 	from the command line for more options
		
			Integrity verification is the primary intent, however 
			a byproduct of this results in a one-click extension auto-update.
