Comments:       video driver for ATI Radeon video cards including all chipsets ranging from
                R100 to R900 and the newer RAxx chipsets
                ----------
		For build notes, see build-dep.
                Some cards require firmware-radeon.tcz when the kernel driver is loaded.
		X2300 (RV516) may hang/panic when this driver is loaded. Reboot with kernel arg
		radeon.modeset=0, load the tcz/module, rmmod it, then modprobe with arg modeset=1.
