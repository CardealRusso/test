Comments:		Based on official Realtek driver v3.4.3_4369.20120622
			forked to kernel-3.8.x  by skeller github
			Driver requires no additional firmware
			Will not work with in-tree version rtl8192cu.ko, therefore
			wireless-3.8.10-tinycore.tcz can not be installed with this driver
			Install,  set DHCP using tc network tools, reboot then
			start your preferred Wireless connection manager
			(for modprobe use 8192cu)
			tested with an RTL8188CUS 802.11n USB WLAN Adapter using wifi.tcz
