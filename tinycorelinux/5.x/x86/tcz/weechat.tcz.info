		If you have no interest in setting up aspell jump to (4)
		(1) $ tce-load -i aspell weechat
		(If you are multilingual add more aspells pls)
		(2) $ weechat-curses (starts weechat or click on wbar icon etc)
		FIRST TIME will output a lot of errors for missing computer
		languages such as python etc.....these have not been made
		dependencies as only needed if you intend to run weechat-scripts
		----but I still had to build the plugin in this package.
		(3) Now in the terminal with weechat running issue commands as
		shown please....after pressing enter, you should see a status change
		For English only users use next line
		/set aspell.check.default_dict en
		For bilingual change lang example
		/set aspell.check.default_dict en,de
		(now all users)
		/set aspell.check.enabled on
		/set aspell.check.real_time on
		/quit (and restart weechat and test with)
		/aspell (to show new options)
		(4) $ tce-load -i aspell weechat
		$ weechat-curses (starts weechat)
		(Ignore any missing output errors)
		/connect irc.freenode.net
		/join #tinycorelinux
