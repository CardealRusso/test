Comments:	MySQL Community Edition is the freely downloadable 
                version of the world's most popular open source database. 
                It is available under the GPL license and is supported 
                by a huge and active community of open source developers.
                
                Only server binaries included.
                If you want to use client binary,
                also download the client package - mysql.
                
                Database files are stored in /usr/local/data.
                You can add this path to filetool to avoid it 
                being recreated during every boot.
                
                Additional (massive!) tools available in mysql-server-tools.
                
                Compiled from source for TC 5.x/6.x.
