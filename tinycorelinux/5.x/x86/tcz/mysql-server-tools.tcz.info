Comments:	MySQL Community Edition is the freely downloadable 
                version of the world's most popular open source database. 
                It is available under the GPL license and is supported 
                by a huge and active community of open source developers.
                
                This package contains some massive maintenance scripts,
                which was splited from main package because of its size 
                and the dependency of perl5 and client tools.
                
                Compiled from source for TC 5.x/6.x.

Change-log:     2015/10/15 : Initial release.
