				Does not require any additional firmware
				Notes:
				Blacklisting in-tree version of rtl8192cu.ko is
				required to use this Realtek version, therefore
				add bootcode
					blacklist=rtl8192cu
				Additionally remove any previously installed Realtek extensions,
				especially wl-r8188eu-3.8.13-tinycore64.tcz due to a symlink
				tested with wifi.tcz on
