Comments:       a "get" script only, contains no binaries. The name of
		executable to run is "firefox-get"
		Please backup any existing wolf.tcz* if you plan to use script
		to update.
		First type the version number you want...... eg 23.0.1
		------and press the enter key
		wget will try to download that product, unless you left
		firefox*.bz2 in your home folder, that matches your input.
		Next type your choice from one of the following:
		exit  local  tcz
		-----and press the enter key
		You can run the script again and choose something different.
		If you typed tcz and pressed enter, wolf.tcz is generated and
		is designed not to conflict with any mozilla web browser.
		/usr/local/bin/wolf links to /usr/local/wolf/firefox
		If you typed local and pressed enter, you are running firefox from
		your home folder but .local/bin/wolf should work.
		"local" users now have the option to have smaller updates.
		Compiled for 5.x
