		Add to GMPC an editor for song tags.
                The tagedit plugin for GMPC adds a editor panel for editing song
                tags. With the plugin enabled, you are able to queue one or more
                songs to the Tag editor from the playlist or song browser. You
                may then enter the Tag editor panel and modify the tags of the
                queued songs one by one or by groups. The changes are recorded
                when you hit the Save button. If you made a mistake while
                editing tags, you may discard the changes you made to one song
                or a group of songs.
