Comments:	MySQL Community Edition is the freely downloadable 
                version of the world's most popular open source database. 
                It is available under the GPL license and is supported 
                by a huge and active community of open source developers.
                
                Only client binaries included.
                If you want to use client libraries,
                check one of other packages - mysql-lib.
                If you want to install MySQL server,
                this is also not a good choice - get mysql-server.
                
                Additional (massive!) tools available in mysql-tools.
                
                Compiled from source for TC 5.x/6.x.

Change-log:     2015/10/15 : Initial release.
Current:        2015/10/15 : Initial release.
