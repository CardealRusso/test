                Alsa sound needs to be setup first.
                Clicking the Audio setup may work for 
                some members for output/input choices but does
                not change volume settings

                To mute or unmute sound in alsamixer
                use arrow key to get to relevant control
                Press m key to toggle off or on each control

                Press page up or arrow up to raise volumes etc 
                Some controls that do not use m, use up/down arrows

                To activate mic in alsamixer, Press F4 & use arrow key 
                to get to relevant Capture (mic) control
                Press space bar to toggle on or off each mic control as a tower
                often has front and rear inputs. Laptops should be simple.
                Raise volumes similar to outputs

                Read alsa info on saving settings over reboot
