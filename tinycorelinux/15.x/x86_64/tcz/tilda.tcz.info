Comments:       Recommend you read all info tilda-doc TCE please 
                as it affects keybindings, configs etc

                Note it is important to know that while tilda is active,
                if you wish to do things outside tilda, press F1 to roll it up
                otherwise you can not escape tilda. And other instances F2 etc

                2 main ways to exit tilda are Ctrl + Shift + q or $ exit
                Key bindings can now change.

                On Wayland, you may prefer enable dbus (Optional dep) -
                enable dbus and use dbus desktop that claims
                "/usr/local/bin/tilda --dbus"

                in mc TCE, arrow down works but you may like to try vifm TCE
