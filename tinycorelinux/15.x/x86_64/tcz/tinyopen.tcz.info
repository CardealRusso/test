Comments:       - After loading this extension, well-behaved applications (i.e.,
                  those that call xdg-open or parse mimeapps.list) will 
                  automatically start using tinyopen
                - For less well-behaved applications (i.e., those that 
                  maintain their own list of filetype associations--larger 
                  applications such as web browsers and file managers usually
                  fall into this category) to also use tinyopen, you need to go
                  into the application's settings and tell it to use tinyopen
                  to open all filetypes; how to do this varies between
                  applications, but it usually goes something like this:
                  Edit -> Preferences -> Filetype Associations
                - The file that contains all your filetype associations and
                  controls tinyopen is ~/.config/tinyopen.conf
                - If your home directory is not persistent, don't forget to 
                  include your customized ~/.config/tinyopen.conf in your backup
                - It is best to not load xdg-utils.tcz when using tinyopen; if
                  you must load xdg-utils.tcz (e.g., because it is a dependency
                  of an extension you use), then load tinyopen.tcz *after* 
                  loading xdg-utils.tcz
                - To troubleshoot, run this command in a terminal and watch its
                  output as you open various files: $ tail -f /tmp/tinyopen.log
