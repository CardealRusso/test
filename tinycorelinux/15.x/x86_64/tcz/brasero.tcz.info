Comments:       Audio cds depend on your player support. 
                wav mp3 ogg opus supported. While adding files
                to audio project, ensure the type remains audio disc.
                Burnt audio discs do not get mounted, open with a 
                media player eg qmplay2 vlc etc
                If you can mount it, its a data cd.
 
                Basically any file can be added to a data disc.
                Mount issues are similar to disc images below.

                TC isohybrid images and other images need to be
                set manually, they are iso9660 types.
                Disc images, data discs need mounting after
                burn with $ mnttool                 

                A blank disc will never mount.
