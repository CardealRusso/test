		Resizer version 0.20 Jul 10 2021 23:46:16
		Copyright Richard A. Rost July 2,2021

		Resizer starts a program and then resizes and moves its
		window based on the options passed in.

		Usage:

		  Resizer -p program args [-x N] [-y N] [-w N] [-h N] [-f] [-d N] [-b] [-D]

			-p program plus arguments in quotes
			-x X position  -y Y position  -w Width  -h Height
			-f Fullscreen
			-d Delay N seconds, then move/resize window
			-b No window manager present
			-D Display ID and geometry of window under mouse, ^C exits

			Use -d when a program:
				Puts up a splash dialog before its window
				Displays its window and later moves it

			Your screen size is 1920 x 1080


		Built with:
		CFLAGS=-flto -fuse-linker-plugin -mtune=generic -Os -g  -pipe -Wall -Wextra -fno-plt
		LDFLAGS=-Wl,-T/usr/local/lib/ldscripts/elf_x86_64.xbn

		Examples:
			Start Midnight Commander in the /etc directory.
			Resizer -p "xterm -e mc /etc" -x320 -y320 -w800 -h600

			Start Tinycores default editor extra wide.
			Resizer -p "editor ~/.profile" -x 100 -w 1000

			If starting from a terminal, disable stdout and stderr.
			Resizer -p "claws-mail-start 2>&1 > /dev/null" -x 0 -y 0

		Notes:
			Programs that insist on displaying a startup dialog before
			displaying the main window need  -d. Wireshark for example.

			Programs that display their main window and then later decide
			to adjust their size/position need  -d. Firefox for example.

			Programs that remember their window settings or have a geometry
			option don't really need Resizer, though you can still use it.

			Resizer starts your command in the background automatically.
			Do NOT append an & to your command. Do NOT background Resizer.

			If you are running X without a window manager (kiosk) then
			use the  -b  option to make Resizer aware of that.

Change-log:	2021/07/08 Original release v0.10
Current:	2021/07/10 v0.20 Added -f and -D options.
