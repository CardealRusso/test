Comments:        If you launch by wbar or desktop icon, load/onboot list - an xterm friendly VT 
                 such as aterm or lxterminal, dependency not set AND
                 aterm, lxterminal, sakura, tilda--- wheel mouse & SELECT mouse button work
                 as does page up/down. Only aterm arrow up/down work for me. Other VTs not tested
                                
                 Optional deps:  perl5 for misc. functions
                 No support for trash can
                 
                 mc allows live config changes, mc-> Options -> Configuration 

                 mc has read-write file association files under extension dir=
                 /usr/local/libexec/mc/ext.d
                 Any you change and want over reboot, add to your backup please
                 eg usr/local/libexec/mc/ext.d/doc.sh (we drop leading /)                 
                 Also--examining doc.sh for example reveals that we could use
                 xpdf-tools or poppler23-bin internal view of PDF (pdftotext)
                 and so on.
