Comments:        (UPGRADERS pls note) menu, wbar or desktop icon changes from aterm to xterm 
                 If $ xterm does not launch your terminal and you prefer it over aterm..... 
                 1) Remove aterm from your boot list, add your preferred terminal to bootlist
                    Hint lxterminal has a full xterm function
                 2) Create a sym link as below
                    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/<name-of-terminal> /usr/local/bin/xterm
                    Add new file to your backup or do it manually each time
                 3) For those using GUI Apps, and xterm fails for your term, load aterm

                 My AMD APU did not allow me to use mc in console mode. This TCE worked in 
                 console mode correctly on a intel gfx so YMMV. If console does not work 
                 please try vifm which works for me both console and VT 

                 If your terminal does not allow arrow up/down navigation. Choose A or B
                 (A) $ export TERM=xterm && mc 
                     aterm, lxterminal, sakura, tilda and urxvt arrow down/up work by default
                     Other terms not tested by me
                 (B) For lazy people like me, run as non-root
                     $ echo export export TERM=xterm >> $HOME/.ashrc
                       This allows allows arrow navigation in all tabs compared to (A)
                 
                 TCE=vt-color-test will prove you will not lose 256 color
                                
                 Optional deps:  perl5 for misc. functions
                 No support for trash can
                 On first launch configs at ~/.config/mc
                 mc allows live config changes, mc-> Options -> Configuration 

                 mc now has read-write file association files under extension dir=
                 /usr/local/libexec/mc/ext.d
                 Any you change and need over reboot, add to your backup please.
                 eg usr/local/libexec/mc/ext.d/doc.sh (we drop leading /)                 
                 Also--examining doc.sh for example reveals that we could use
                 xpdf-tools or poppler23-bin internal view of PDF (pdftotext)
                 and so on. 

                 Please read -doc and -locale TCEs 
                 mouse is supported this build
