Comments:       ~/.jwmrc has config line 
                <Include>./.jwmrc-theme</Include>
                Only if you or maintainer have changed that line, 
                do you need to change below's instruction.
                
                                Copy from 
/tmp/tcloop/jwm-themes/usr/local/share/jwm-themes/<dir-name>/.jwmrc-theme
                to root of your $HOME dir so it becomes 
                eg /home/tc/.jwmrc-theme
                Agree to over write existing theme.
                Read it in a text editor, browser etc
                Load the named font eg DejaVu Sans-10 comes from 
                TCE= dejavu-fonts-ttf.tcz
                Some font TCEs offer alternative fonts
                eg liberation and nimbus*                

                Beauty is in the mind of the beholder.
                I believe dark theme is Adwaita-Dark,
                light is Aros, blue is Bluesky-1, green is beach and 
                2 contrasts are DarkMint (yes its dark) and Numix 

                Naturally you can edit to change fonts, colours etc
