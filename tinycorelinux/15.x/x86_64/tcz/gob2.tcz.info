Comments:       GOB (GOB2 anyway) is a preprocessor for making GObjects with
                inline C code so that generated files are not edited. Syntax
                is inspired by Java and Yacc or Lex. The implementation is
                intentionally kept simple, and no C actual code parsing is done.
