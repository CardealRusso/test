Comments:       Normal recorders output format=.mp4 etc. This TCE  
                records your terminal outputs (not keys pressed)
                eg inxi -Gxxx (not Ctrl + c ) and format=.cast
                
                This is a simple recorder that lacks transcoding
                which affects terminal dimensions. I suggest
                use maximised terminal OR terminal playback 
                resolution LARGER than recorded dimension. That way, 
                you will always be able to playback. Ignore if you have 
                a web browser link, as below.

                Local recording 
                ###############
                $ asciinema rec demo.cast
                To End type "exit" without quotes & press enter
                               
                Local playback 
                ##############
                $ asciinema play -i 2 demo.cast
                The idle time of 2 seconds is important, otherwise
                playback occurs after 10 seconds. Patience is a virtue

                Upon completion, server prints a secret link you can 
                use to watch your recording in a web browser.
