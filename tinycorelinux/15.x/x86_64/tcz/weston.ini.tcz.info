                Install script does not overwrite any existing ini file

                At time of posting, there is a broken pipe issue if you run
                $ tce-load <TCEs> in weston-terminal so I have changed the ini
                to show sakura but its not a dep!
                sakura is gtk3 so can run on pure wayland. 

                After downloading this TCE, load it and edit it to your preferences using links above.

                weston does not have xwayland as a dep. Its needed if you intend to run
                any of the fltk GUIs eg exittc, mntttol, apps. I have disabled xwayland in 
                2 settings in case you prefer not to use xwayland.

                Without xwayland run $ exitcheck.sh reboot (to reboot) or drop reboot to poweroff

Change-log:     2018/11/27  v 1 
                2024/04/05  v 2
Current:        2024/04/22 fix xwayland & mention sakura terminal for broken pipe issue
