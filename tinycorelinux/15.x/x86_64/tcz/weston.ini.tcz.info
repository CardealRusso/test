Comments:       (UPGRADERS) Move your current ini file somewhere safe 
                if you plan to load this one please, as install script
                will over write existing ini under ~/.config but not other paths

                You will get an toolbar icon - looks like  X if you have 
                not loaded its app. Not loaded toolbar apps do not 
                bork weston but bork is high if missing autolaunch TCEs....YMMV
                I am on AMD APU and did limited testing on x11 and drm
                drm is default console backend. I was unable to test wayland BE
                x11 is default libX/Xorg* desktop -yes 2 desktops at once
                wayland BE may be able to use TCE=wlr-randr YMMV
                
                Do not include SVG icons as they are not currently supported.
                Other than links above also run $ weston -h

                There are different ways to set modes as there are backends of
                drm headless rdp pipewire vnc wayland x11. see 2nd link
                I have set yours to off to attempt to use monitor preferred mode.

                If renderer=gl TCE=vulkan-tools $ vkcube-wayland may result in spinning cube 
                Other TCEs to consider are fonts

                If xwayland is working, GUI=exittc should work but if you find its not....try
                $ /usr/bin/exittc  # will take you back to console and if that fails press
                Ctrl + Alt + backspaces keys
