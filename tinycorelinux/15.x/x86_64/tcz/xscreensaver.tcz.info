                System config is /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver
                is over ridden by home config, when you make a preference change.
                Most greyed out screensavers are opengl ones which have 
                not been compiled or glitchy screensavers I have removed.
                Ignore any terminal output about missing libGLU.so.1
                as its a dep of deleted opengl savers please.
                                    
                Mode 1 without a password= screen savers 
                
                Mode 2 if password set allows screen, once locked,
                to open only with correct password. Please make changes 
                at mode 1 first, so you have a home config.
                
                It is normal (but can be changed) for the screen to fade 
                to darkness. Before darkness you can click an input device 
                to stop that process.
                    
                1) Mode 1 has no "login" password so no lock so you 
                untick the lock box please. Run 
                $ xscreensaver-demo
                                
                Popup will ask to start daemon -> select Yes. 
                
                Choose your preferences, file is saved to
                ~/.xscreensaver Click on preview to see effects. 
                Click any kb key or mouse to stop demo.
                                        
                If after test you like it, autostart it with
                echo 'xscreensaver -nosplash &' > ~/.X.d/xscreensaver
                                    
                2) Mode 2 -> After setting screensaver preferences, 
                run $ passwd  
                to setup a password for local user. Consider persistence 
                of your password by backing up /etc/shadow
                Do not move mouse or kb clicks for the time you set to test.
                Click mouse or kb -> password input box appears.
                
                3) Faster mode 2 lock -> run the command
                $ lockx
