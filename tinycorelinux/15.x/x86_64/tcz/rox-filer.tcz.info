                Icon themes under ~/.icons
                To open 2 FMs at same time eg $ rox /home/tc /usr/local/bin
                Home config DIR is ~/.config/rox.sourceforge.net
                To start a panel you can drag more dirs to ...$ rox -t=MyPanel
                ^ change -t (top) to -b (bottom) if you prefer.
                I assume you are a Right Hand (RH) mouse user
                To open context menu (preferences) click RH mouse button
                either inside any rox panel or rox FM

                How to set a default app to open (example) png
                $ tce-load -i <your-preferred-TCE> eg mtpaint
                In FM, RH click any png file
                Click "Set Run Action"
                click radio button for either all image types or just png
                Click into shell command and prefix command so it reads
                mtpaint "$@"
                ("$@" will already exist, with luck)
                LH click...... Use Command button
                -----to test you now need to LH click the png file

                Please click on the Help button. You need to see all the options please.
