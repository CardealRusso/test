Comments:       shoot 3 bubbles of same colour to clear them.
                Any bubbles dependent on cleared bubbles will clear too.
                Game is over if bubbles reach a marked line.
                1 or 2 player + player vs computer modes
                5 difficulty levels but no sound.
                3 themes default is fancy
                
                To try another theme run
                $ xbubble -t frozen (or plain )
$ xbubble [-d display] [-s scale] [-f framerate] [-r resourcepath] [-t theme]
                but on Debian and here, most settings do not work
                IMHO frozen theme looks like frozen-bubble

                -s 100 gave me full screen
