Comments:       First run sets up $HOME/.config/worker dir & files
                Unlike mc, worker opens in a new window.
                Popup offers to configure 12 European languages 
                EN config has been modified for some TCEs as below. 
                I have not attempted to convert all executables to our TCEs
                If you edit, popup will request restart worker. 
       
                No udisks support compiled so use mnttool pls
                aterm has dependencies for worker but you are free to 
                use your preferred terminal.
                Click (or double click) button top LH corner next to 
                A button allows GUI config edits if you do not want manual edits

                Can use kb hotkeys or mouse clicks similar to mc.
                Hotkeys can be changed. 

                If you load extra TCEs you would like worker to use,
                please run 
                $ /usr/local/tce.installed/shared-mime-info

                Both F3 & F4 font remains black font and "Floating" popup opens

                Internal edit (F4) uses "xterm -e nano {A}"
                which works with aterm and lxterminal.
                Edit config to to your preferred terminal if you prefer
                internal edits. Ditto change nano to your preferred CLI editor.
                Otherwise use GUI TCE for edits (eg) "leafpad {A}" 
                ---> then F4 will open a GUI text editor.

                F8 (delete) 
                ###########
                Please look at the file & dir count at top of selected pane shown in Red
                clicking on a file/dir multiple times toggles the font
                from black -> white -> black in a loop
                ONLY white font will be deleted
                (Actually only white font can be actioned such as move copy etc)
                If you click "invert selection button" all files/dirs are white font
                Here is an example = Files 1/9 Dirs 2/10 means 3 items have been
                highlighted for deletion. F8 -> Then a popup warns about non-empty dirs

                Optional deps Use enter button, not F3/F4 to open external TCE
                Read info files for supported formats and extra dependencies
                abiword, audacious, flaxpdf, imagemagick, leafpad, mpv & mtpaint(-gtk3)  

                Bottom BUTTONS
                Options to move to trash can are dependent on your desktop
                supporting such. 
                Hover mouse for hints for most buttons.
                Note to go up dir in mc, page up to get to top of sub-dir 
                then press enter against /..
                In worker we just use the backspace
