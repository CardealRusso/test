Comments:	keybinder is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts to be used by GTK-based
		applications under the X Window System.

		When a combination of key is pressed, keybinder notifies it to the registering application,
		which can execute one or more operations based on the event previously registered.

		Originally written as part of the Tomboy project, keybinder has been distributed as
		stand-alone library let other applications to use key binding.

		This is the Gtk+3 version of the library.
