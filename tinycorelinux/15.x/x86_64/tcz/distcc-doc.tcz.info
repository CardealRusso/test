Comments:	----------
		These are doc files for extension distcc.
		distcc is a program for distributing C/C++ compilation across
		several networked machines. It is often 2x or more faster than
		local compile.
		The installation script appends port 3632 to /etc/services.
		To use distcc, you will need to ...
		1) modify:
			/usr/local/etc/hosts
			/usr/local/etc/clients.allow
		by adding the LAN IPs of your distcc servers.
		2) start distccd on each server using:
			distccd --daemon --allow CLIENT_IP
		where CLIENT_IP is the LAN IP of your primary build system.
		3) export CC='distcc gcc' and CXX='distcc g++' before you
		call make.
		This extension includes distccmon-gnome, which requires
		libglade and its dep gtk2. libglade is NOT in the distcc
		dep file, as the monitor is only useful on the primary
		build machine. To use the monitor, you must first load
		extension libglade.
