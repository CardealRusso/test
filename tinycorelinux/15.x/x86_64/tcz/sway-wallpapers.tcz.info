Comments:       Splits out wallpapers to make sway TCE smaller.
                This is TCE is a removeable dep once you edit your config as below
                --- changing the pathway and filenames of course

                Your current config =
                output * bg /usr/local/share/backgrounds/sway/Sway_Wallpaper_Blue_1920x1080.png fill
                Edit to something like
                output * bg /home/tc/2wallpaper/cat-lick.jpeg fill

                Save the config change and test it within sway by 
                logo + z
                If your wallpaper appears, delete this TCE from sway.tcz.dep

                You are free to have no wallpaper too by deleting this TCE and no config to 
                any image.
