Comments:       best GNU/Linux application for annotating PDF files
                ----------
                ghostscript.tcz is needed for some functionality (to import PS/PDF files as bitmap backgrounds)
                but is not needed for annotating PDF files.
                ----------
                To annotate a PDF file (e.g., to fill out a form):
                1. File -> Annotate PDF -> choose desired file
                2. Click on Text tool -> click on form fields and type into them
                3. When done with form: File -> Export to PDF -> choose a new filename
                ----------
