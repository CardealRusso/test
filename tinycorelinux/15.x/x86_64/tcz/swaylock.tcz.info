Comments:       Before using you will need to create a password for 
                local login. You may like to persist the password files 
                over reboot? etc/passwd and etc/shadow 

                To LOCK
                $ swaylock -fl # l for lima 1
                which daemonises the locker and locks screen
                And prompts if you have caps lock on. It will not prompt 
                if you are using Shift key to input one or more letters in caps

                To UNLOCK
                <type passwd> You will see a circle appear and a change in indicator
                upon each press.......When you have typed full password, press Enter

                green indicator shows correct input for each letter
                red indicator at least one error in input of password
                If you mistype ---you can try again

                TCE=sway has z file which uses shadow for password 
                management. Other Wayland desktops may not use shadow? 
                TCE=swaylock-doc has loads of options if interested
