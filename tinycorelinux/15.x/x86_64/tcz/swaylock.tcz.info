Comments:       Before using you will need to create a password for 
                local login. You may like to persist the password files 
                over reboot? etc/passwd and etc/shadow 

                To LOCK
                $ swaylock -f
                which daemonises the locker and locks screen

                To UNLOCK
                <type passwd> You will see a circle appear and a change in indicator
                upon each press.......When you have typed full password, press Enter
