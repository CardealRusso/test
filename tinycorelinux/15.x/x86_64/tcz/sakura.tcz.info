Comments:       Can support UTF-8. Does not have a menu bar 
                but has a context menu (GUI)
                First run creates the config file at 
                ~/.config/sakura/sakura.conf 
                or to start afresh by delete config and re-run sakura.
               
                Do not edit that file for font names or sizes please.
                I noticed a diff in font names so I recommend you use
                context menu -> options -> select font
                eg Sans Regular 16 
                config will be autogenerated under ~/.config/sway 
                Actual config line reads Sans 16

                The config file does not mention that the action keys
                for certain keyboard combos is hold Ctrl and Shift = C+S
                Toggle on/off scroll  C+S s  (or use GUI)
                Copy = C+S  c (or use GUI)
                Paste = C+S v (or use GUI)

                The "+" or hypehn sign is used for next line.
                Increase/decrease font size = C "+" / C -
