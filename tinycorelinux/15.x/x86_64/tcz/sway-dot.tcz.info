                assumes you have downloaded/updated sway
                
                /home/$USER/.config/sway/help.txt will autostart with sway
               
                /home/$USER/.local/bin/resetenv attempts to reset environment 
                values, if you choose to go from sway back to your libX
                desktop without a full reboot. Best run once back in libX/Xorg
