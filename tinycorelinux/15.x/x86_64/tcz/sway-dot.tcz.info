Comments:       This TCE is a DownloadOnly so not to be added to 
                your boot list file. It is run once by  
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot
                or load again if any of your changes causes a bork.
                Script destroys Z, help & resetenv 

                exe=z will load and launch sway (separate download)
                       
                exe=resetenv attempts to reset environment values, 
                     if you choose to go from sway to your X desktop
                     without a full reboot. Run it when you are in X
              
                sway should not be launched on X please
