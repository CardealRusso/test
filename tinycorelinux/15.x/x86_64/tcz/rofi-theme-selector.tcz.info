Comments:       This TCE uses same icon as main TCE
                rofi defaults to fancy theme.  

                If you like to view others, load this TCE and 
                press enter against each theme, except dmenu.
                Once you are happy with a theme, press Alt + a to accept
                new selection. Or press Escape to keep current theme.
                Use wbar or run 
                $ rofi-theme-selector

                Alt + a edits config to usr/share/* pathway So...
                Copy any new theme from tcloop/TCE/usr/local/share/rofi/themes/
                -> $HOME/.config/rofi/themes

                Independent themes can also be used see
                https://github.com/newmanls/rofi-themes-collection
                and other like minded sites 
                TC has a man-page for this TCE too 

                Be aware the following have font settings which over rule config
                arthur, c64, dmenu & docu
                
                The last line of your config should read as <change name of theme>
                and pathway
                @theme "/home/tc/.config/rofi/themes/<new theme>.rasi"
                If you lack confidence to do this, keep this TCE loading which has
                a dep of rofi
