                Most preferences can change via menu button or context menu. 
                Please read configs under ~/icewm. TCEs named in keyboard 
                shortcuts have no deps set except lxterminal. I am unable to 
                test on basic X so am using  Xorg-7.7 (2d) as a dep. Be aware 
                that IceWM uses this order: prefoverride over theme over preferences
                
                icewmbg can control background or wallpaper(s) Or use pcmanfm 
                for another wallpaper method  https://tinyurl.com/y3ouvb94

                For all changes to a config file, or any TCE added after boot,
                that has a kb combo set.....needs WM refresh with kb combo of
                logo+z      logo = Super key
                Please input logo+z in an empty workspace for maximum safety

                optional TCEs not already mentioned include: 
                icewm-themes only nanoblue theme in this TCE
                icewm-locale..xscreensaver and read infos please
                menumaker (for menu generation each time you load a new TCE) 
                I prefer it over icewm-menu-fdo              
                
                To allow you to keep wbar, ~/icewm/preferences 
                now reads TaskBarAtTop=1 # 0/1

                On my AMD APU, I needed Xorg-7.7 too....YMMV

                If you see a locale error in your terminal by running 
                $ icewm -V 
                Paste the following into your .ashrc ( change lang to suit)
                export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8" && export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
                (and I have no mention of G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@locale
                or any other locale setting in .ashrc .bashrc .profile)

New Features
