Comments:       micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy
                to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the
                capabilities of modern terminals. It comes as a single,
                batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies.
                ----------
                As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a
                successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and
                use. It strives to be enjoyable as a full-time editor for
                people who prefer to work in a terminal, or those who
                regularly edit files over SSH.
                ----------
                Features:
                    No dependencies 
                    Multiple cursors.
                    Common keybindings (Ctrl-s, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-v, Ctrl-z, â€¦).
                        Keybindings can be rebound to your liking.
                    Splits and tabs.
                    nano-like menu to help you remember the keybindings.
                    Extremely good mouse support.
                        This means mouse dragging to create a selection,
                        double click to select by word, and triple click
                        to select by line.
                    Plugin system (plugins are written in Lua).
                        micro has a built-in plugin manager to automatically
                        install, remove, and update plugins.
                    Built-in diff gutter.
                    Simple autocompletion.
                    Persistent undo.
                    Automatic linting and error notifications.
                    Syntax highlighting for over 130 languages.
                    Color scheme support.
                        By default, micro comes with 16, 256, and true
                        color themes.
                    True color support (set the MICRO_TRUECOLOR environment
                        variable to 1 to enable it).
                    Copy and paste with the system clipboard.
                    Small and simple.
                    Easily configurable.
                    Macros.
                    Common editor features such as undo/redo, line numbers,
                        Unicode support, soft wrapping
                ----------
