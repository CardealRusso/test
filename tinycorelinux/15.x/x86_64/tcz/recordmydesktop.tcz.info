                Pulseaudio snd_hda_intel users, if you have an error 
                "Couldn't open PCM device hw:0,0"
                Implies HDMI is device=0 not analog, suggest fix by
                adding to grub.cfg
                blacklist=snd_hda_intel 
                and creating an executable $HOME/.local/bin/sound contents=
                #!/bin/sh
                sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel enable=0
                
                Plus create a normal file under $HOME/.X.d/sound with contents=
                /home/tc/.local/bin/sound & 
                Change to suit localusername.

                Full reboot please to test
