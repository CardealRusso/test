Comments:       gtk3/gst/webkit web browser that has
                vim like key bindings and modes and
                supports mouse too.
                * Normal Mode -The default mode. 
                Pressing Escape always enter normal mode.
                * Input Mode
                Used for editing text elements in a webpage.
                * Command Mode
                Execute "ex" commands from the builtin inputbox (commandline).
                * Pass Through Mode
                Only the Esc and <C-[) keybindings are interpreted by Vimb, 
                all other keystrokes are given to the webview to handle them. This 
                allows the use of a website's configured keybindings, that
                might otherwise be swallowed by Vimb.   
                
                If you are mouse adverse you must read man page
                on Hinting. 

                I have made a home page and we start in input 
                mode at duckduckgo. 

                For new web address -> normal mode then input 
                shift+o <URL> 
                = capital Oh web address
                                
                Recommend you read the man page in vimb-doc. 
                Please change any setting you want at 
                $HOME/.config/vimb/config (and style.css)
                If you want sound, setup independently and 
                it should work when you launch vimb
 
                Altho 84K size looks good compare against
                totals for your other web browser due to deps
