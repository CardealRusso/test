                How-to: (once you have a working internet connection)
                $ sudo cp /usr/local/share/stubby/stubby.yml /usr/local/etc/stubby/
                * DoT server settings go in /usr/local/etc/stubby/stubby.yml
                  (in the "upstream_recursive_servers" section)
                $ sudo cp /usr/local/share/stubby/resolv.conf /etc/
                $ tce-load -wi dnsmasq
                $ sudo cp /usr/local/share/stubby/dnsmasq.conf /etc/
                $ sudo stubby -g
                $ sudo dnsmasq &

                Notes:
                * In the how-to above, dnsmasq is used to cache DNS lookups
                  because stubby does not have a built-in cache
                * To prevent udhcpc from changing /etc/resolv.conf, do this:
                  $ sudo sed -i 's_/etc/resolv\.conf_/dev/null_' /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script
