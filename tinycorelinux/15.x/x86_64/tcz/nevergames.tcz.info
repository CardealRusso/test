Comments:       see nevergames-doc please
                Both games play on Xorg-3d, sway, labwc or weston
                Fails to run on Xorg 2d on my AMD APU 
                If Xorg 3d -  needs setup first please.
                Sound does not need setup as it uses sdl2  
                Both games look excellent. Accepts  keyboard,
                mouse, trackball or gamepad but gamepad not tested. 
                Some settings mouse only.  Games have different modes.  

                Optional dep for gamepad=input-joystick-KERNEL             

                game 1=neverball
                Tilt the floor to roll a ball through an obstacle course 
                within the given time. If the ball falls or time expires, 
                a ball is lost. Collect coins to unlock the exit and earn 
                extra balls. Red coins are  worth 5. Blue coins are worth 
                10. A ball is awarded for 100 coins. 

                game 2=neverputt  a mini golf game.
                IMHO this is much harder.
