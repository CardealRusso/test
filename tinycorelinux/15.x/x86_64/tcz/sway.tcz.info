                Your config is $HOME/.config/sway/config
                
                This TCE may suit members who do not mind reading the config and 
                using keyboard shortcuts/combinations to launch their fav apps. 
                You can still use a mouse to shift focus, or click into an already
                opened workspace or for web browsing.

                Know your active App is the last loaded app on your current workspace.
                OR its the one with the blue titlebar, while inactive Apps are black titlebar.

                If you change ~/.config/sway/config, run from within sway
                logo + z (see config ) --and check for no errors appearing at top of
                monitor.

                FIRST TIME USE
                ###############
                Download this App and sway-dot, then load sway-dot
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot
                If you make changes to z and z crashes, delete it
                and reload sway-dot. 

                VIDEO DRIVERS
                #############
                Closed source drivers are not supported by sway.

                Running Sway

                Optional dependencies
                ##################
                leafpad can be removed from dep file if you prefer something else.
                lxterminal but make sure you modify and test config please,
                as you need a terminal set.

                grim and slurp (take screenshots)
                dmenu  (a launcher. Must have xwayland loaded and enabled)
                wl-clipboard (terminal clipboard manager if not using a 
                              terminal with copy and paste support)
                swaylock (lock screen read info please)
 
                ########
                xwayland allows most apps to run on wayland.
                I recommend you remove wbar, from boot list, if you like sway.

                You can not use logo + l (or) r as these interfere with 
                shortcuts with logo + left (<- arrow) to shift focus to
                App left of current active app. Ditto right (-> arrow)
                Which is why leafpad can not use logo + l
                
                caplock is set to off---numlock to on...see config if interested

                ##########
                1) in sway for sudo su users,
                 command echo $PATH gives a reduced set of pathways to executables
                 run 
                 PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin

                2) Going from sway -> prompt -> startx
                local user loses full pathway too! same fix as above
                PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
                Note I do not use ondemand
