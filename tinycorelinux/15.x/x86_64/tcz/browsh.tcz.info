Comments:       For those that suffer slow and/or expensive Internet.

                TCE works by rendering the pages (& videos altho not worth watching) 
                in headless Firefox & then injects multiple scripts including the UTF-8  
                half-block trick to get 2 colors from every character cell, to simulate
                basic graphics. Firefox v57 or newer needs to be loaded & use
                true color terminal.  Otherwise, toggle on  monochrome setting.
                
                No firefox dependency set. Host firefox must be loaded
                but not needed to be open. TCE allow multiple tabs.

                Can also run at the exit prompt. (tty)  But you lose the ability to 
                copy and paste from other applications. I am unable to copy from TCE.

                Optional TCE=vt-color-test for true color test. 
                Recommended TCE=lxterminal for true color PLUS mouse support for paste

                Paste FAILS with context menu terminals, but lxterminal offers mouse clickable 
                pulldown Edit -> paste.  So you can save bookmarks/urls in a text file 
                to copy and paste from.
            
                Keybindings   below CTRL = C (+ means hold C and press other key)
