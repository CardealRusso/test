Comments:       This is a CLI utility for displaying current network
                utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname.
                bandwhich sniffs a given network interface and records IP
                packet size, cross referencing it with the /proc
                filesystem on linux. It is responsive to the terminal
                window size, displaying less info if there is no room
                for it. It will also attempt to resolve IPs to their
                host name in the background using reverse DNS on a best
                effort basis.
