                home config is 
                ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/parole.xml

                Video sub-titles not tested. You may need more fonts.
                If you load a screensaver, kill it.

                Audio: config already enabled and loads headphones (bcm2835)
                Which also allows my desktop speakers to sing to me.
                Read config.txt for hdmi issues please

                Plays most formats like mp3, mp4 etc but not .m4a (AAC) nor 
                .flac audio files. Some .mkv videos lose audio output 

                With parole open, tools -> plugins -> enable tray plugin and it works in jwm

                YMMV
