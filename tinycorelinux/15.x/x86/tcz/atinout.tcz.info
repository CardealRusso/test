Comments:       Atinout reads a list of AT commands. It sends those commands one by one to the modem,
                waiting for the final result code for the currently running command before continuing
                with the next command in the list. The output from the commands is saved.

                Notice that atinout is strictly about sending AT commands only;
                it cannot be used for AT commands that expect additional input data (e.g. AT+CMGS etc).
