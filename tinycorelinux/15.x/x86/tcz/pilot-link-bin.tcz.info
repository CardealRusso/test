Comments:       pilot-link is a suite of tools used to connect your
                Palm or PalmOS compatible handheld with Unix, Linux
                and any other POSIX-compatible machine.
                pilot-link works with all PalmOS handhelds, including
                those made by Handspring, Sony, Palm and others.
                This extension consists of numerous binaries removed
                from TC 4 pilot-link-dev.tcz, originally compiled by
                dentonlt in 2010 and tested in Tiny Core versions 3 & 4.
                Significant changes were required to support libusb-1.0
                and Tiny Core.
                Dependencies updated for TC 6. Most binaries tested.
                For usage information, enter the desired command
                without options.
                  Palm Pilot Pro with serial port example:
                       pilot-memos -p /dev/ttyS0                
                  Palm Tungsten with USB connection example:
                       pilot-memos -p usb:
                Note: These binaries are most useful for running Palm 
                GUI related software, such as J-Pilot. For users only
                wanting to backup, restore and install software on a
                Palm device via CLI, the pilot-xfer binary from the
                pilot-link-base.tcz extension is all that is required.
