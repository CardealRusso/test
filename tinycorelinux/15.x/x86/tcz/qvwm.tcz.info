Comments:       Qvwm is a simple, lightweight Windows 95-like window manager for X11.
                It looks much like Windows 95/98, and provides the functions of start menu,
                taskbar, task switcher, configurable keyboard shortcuts and an imitation of
                desktop shortcuts.  Also, it supports virtual screen and a pager functions,
                which are common for X window managers. Furthermore, it deals with any
                languages because it is considered with internationalization.
                --------
                Though qvwm's official version has been released, it may be not stable
                enough in some environments.  I am not responsible for any damages arising
                out of the use of qvwm.
