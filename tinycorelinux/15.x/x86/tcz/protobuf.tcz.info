Comments:       A language-neutral, platform-neutral, way of serializing structured data.
                Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing
                structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how
                you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated
                source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety
                of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data
                structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the
                "old" format.
