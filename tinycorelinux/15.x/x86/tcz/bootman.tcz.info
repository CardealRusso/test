Comments:       Allows the user to boot into numerous versions of
                TCL using a single drive/partition and separate
                mydata.tgz and/or persistent opt/home directories
                sudo bootman VERSION [PLATFORM=x86_64]
                VERSION=5 or more, PLATFORM=x86 or x86_64 (x64)
                ONLY INTENDED for default boot loader; grub not
                yet implemented and PXE not intended here.
