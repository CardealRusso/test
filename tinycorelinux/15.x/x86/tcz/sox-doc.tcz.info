Comments:	SoX reads and writes audio files in most popular formats 
                and can optionally apply effects to them. It can combine 
                multiple input sources, synthesise audio, and, 
                on many systems, act as a general purpose audio player 
                or a multi-track audio recorder. 
                It also has limited ability to split the input 
                into multiple output files.
                
                Documentation files and man pages.
                
                For more information please check the man pages.
