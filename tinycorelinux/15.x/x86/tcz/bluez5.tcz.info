                ----------
                Optionally can use the alsa/pulseaudio extensions for sound over bluetooth.
                Optionally can use the gstreamer and gstplugins-base extensions
                Optionally can use the obex and fuse extensions to transfer files
                ..and mount file systems over bluetooth.
                Optionally can use the blueman extension to pair
                ----------
                This extension contains:
                bluez-5.63 - GPLv2 - https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.63.tar.xz
                ----------
                Howto:
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/bluez [start|stop|restart|status]
                ..in my case, this loads all required modules
                ----------
                To enable sound with pulseudio:
                use blueman to pair
                right-click on bt headphones and select "trust" and "audio sink"
                use pavucontrol to select bt headphones as output device
                use rhythmbox or xmms-pulse to play to bt headphones
