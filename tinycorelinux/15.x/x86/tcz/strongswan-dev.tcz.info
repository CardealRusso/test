Comments:       StrongSwan is an OpenSource IPsec implementation.
                strongSwan originally was designed for Linux, but has since been ported
                to Android, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Windows and other platforms.
                The focus of strongSwan is on:
                'simplicity of configuration
                strong encryption and authentication methods
                powerful IPsec policies supporting large and complex VPN networks
                modular design with great expandability
