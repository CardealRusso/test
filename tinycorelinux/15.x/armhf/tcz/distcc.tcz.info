                Getting started:
                  Prepare 2 or more machine
                On Volunteer: (Server, Helper)
                  Load this extension,
                  the daemon will start automatically.
                  To fine tune the behavior,
                  create ~/.distcc/tc.sh
                  The example file is in
                    /usr/local/share/doc/distcc/tc.sh
                On Worker: (Client, You compile here)
                  Create ~/.distcc/tc.sh but keep it empty,
                  the daemon will not start, which it shouldn't.
                    $ touch ~/.distcc/tc.sh
                    $ filetool.sh -b
                  Edit ~/.distcc/hosts
                    localhost
                    192.168.0.30,lzo,cpp
                  In terminal
                    $ export PATH="/usr/lib/distcc:${PATH}"
                    $ ./configure ...
                    $ pump make -j8
