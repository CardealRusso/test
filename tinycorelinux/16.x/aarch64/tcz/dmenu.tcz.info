Comments:       A tool that can search executables on X (or Sway) 
                Then attempts to launch the highlighted entry           
                when you press the Enter key. Search is exact 
                spelling but not all letters needed

                How to run on X (tested on jwm)
                ###############
                $ dmenu_run 
                For a large font $ dmenu_run -fn sans-20
                Search bar will appear at top of your monitor
                
                Use arrow keys with numlock OFF to navigate to
                your target command or type more letters

                If you pressed enter, you are attempting to 
                launch the highlighted item and dmenu closes.
                Be aware not all commands are meant to be run 
                without parameters.

                If you change your mind press the Escape key. 
                While dmenu is active, you probably can not launch 
                keyboard shortcuts.

                If your search input is for a non-executable (eg) lll 
                you lose all hits and if you forget to Escape and press enter 
                you are launching a missing executable called lll and will get
                a not found error.

                #################
                On flwm, dmenu may cover any open app that is
                at the top of your monitor. So to close an app,
                you may have to either launch an app or press escape,
                while dmenu active.
                You can safely ignore any msg about
                /home/tc/.cache/dmenu_run: No such file or directory
                ^ that file is created, its a list of executables
