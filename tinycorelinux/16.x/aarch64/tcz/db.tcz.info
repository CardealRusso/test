                Reverted to DB version 6.0.19 because beginning with 6.0.20 and up the
                license was amended to require that anyone using the software must also
                allow free access to the software it touches, i.e. web applications, etc.
                OpenLDAP specifically calls out versions 6.0.20+ as incompatible with their license
                ----
                Compiled for piCore 12.x_64
