                ----------
                Hardware:
                I'm using Raspberry pi 4 4G with default setting
                The game is fairly playable, but could be glitchy
                from time to time.
                ----------
                Data:
                Download the official data file and extract
                in your local disk and create links to the system.
                The data directory is configured to:
                /usr/local/games/0ad/
                ----------
                Sound:
                The game is able to run with alsa only.
                If you have pulseaudio in your system,
                the game will use that instead of alsa.
                0ad actually use openal to handle sound.
                Make sure you've pick the right outputting sound card,
                it took me a while to realize my pulseaudio is
                set to HDMI output rather than 3.5 audio jack.
