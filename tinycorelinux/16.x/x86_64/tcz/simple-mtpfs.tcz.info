Comments:	SIMPLE-MTPFS (Simple Media Transfer Protocol FileSystem) is a file system
		capable of operating on files on MTP devices attached via USB to local
		machine. The end user can seamlessly interact with MTP device files as
		part of the overall filesystem. Works in VMware VM's, too.

		Usage:
		To simply mount(when single device is connected):
		$ simple-mtpfs mountpoint [options]
                To list devices:
                $ simple-mtpfs --list-devices
                To mount by number in list:
                $ simple-mtpfs --device <number> mountpoint [options]
                To unmount:
                $ fusermount -u <mountpoint>
