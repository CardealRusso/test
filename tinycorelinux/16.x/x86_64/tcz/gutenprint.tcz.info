                colord.tcz reduce log warnings or if printing colour images
                mupdf.tcz (Very tiny relative to total for evince)
                for print preview 
                1) choose print to file and choose pathway2/output.pdf
                2) $ mupdf /pathway2/output.pdf # output.pdf is default

                Wireless (WL) Printing
                #############
                I recommend you set up your router to reserve an IP for your WL printer first.
                Be aware that some printers advertised as wireless printers may not have
                full hardware.     WL ink levels can be checked by using your web browser 
                eg url= 192.168.1.7  -- once the printer IP is set.

                Epson ink levels, once printer is set up
                # tested in the past on TX100, I no longer have it 
                $ tce-load -wi readline
                $ escputil --raw-device=/dev/usb/lp0 --ink-level
                 ^ if that fails....repeat...if fails try as root.
                 
                Extra printer calibration
                ###################
                $ sudo cups-calibrate
                (and enter only numbers as directed after viewing the test page)

                How to use  after reading above
                ########### 
                $ tce-load -i gutenprint 
                $ [ -f /var/run/cups/cupsd.pid ] || sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start
                $ sudo passwd # to set up a root passwd, if not already set 
                ---------as /usr/local/etc/cups is root owned
                Next, open your web browser to  http://localhost:631/admin

                Do NOT click on "Find New Printer", instead click on Add Printer
                Then make your selection. Remember to click the "Add Printer" button
                to then get options to change paper size etc. At the end of that process
                a popup (ensure you allow popups in browser settings) will 
                ask for user, input root and your new password please. I did not need
                locale set.

                After setup (recommended) pulldown administration and make your printer
                the server default. Then test printer. 

                If printer not found for WL printers run
                $ tce-load -i avahi 
                For my Canon and my Epson I did not need to run next command
                Only run it if you can not find your printer PPD or maybe if you are runnng avahi.
                $ sudo generate-ppd.sh

                For persistence 
                ################
                Add these lines to /opt/.filetool.lst 
                etc/shadow
                usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf
                usr/local/etc/cups/printers.conf
                usr/local/etc/cups/ppd
                ###   ^ this dir contains all your printer PPDs
                
                On reboot
                ##########
                Assuming you have done the persistence suggestions, load gutenprint 
                and then start cups with
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start
                and if you are using a WL printer and need avahi
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/avahi start

                #######################
                NO MATCHING MODEL FOUND
                ######################
                If you are not sure which PPD is best for you, uncompressed PPDs are
                created at /usr/local/share/cups/model/gutenprint/5.3
                after running $ sudo generate-ppd.sh 

                Before rebooting and losing all of them except your persistent ones,
                you may like to copy some into your home dir. CUPS allows you to try 
                a PPD from a non-system pathway.....but for gutenprint it needs to have
                been designed for that version of gutenprint. It may take a few tries
                where you can not find your exact model listed. Good Luck!
                eg you have make Z model 142 so try model 140 then 100 etc
                cups also supplies generic models but these tend to be a bit limited

                One issue to note is
                ####################
                If you have a USB-connected printer, you must have a printer connected 
                to each USB port that you plan to use and powered on when you restart CUPS.  
                If you do not do so, you will not be able to reinstall the printer. It is only 
                necessary to do this if you wish to update PPD files manually; if you use 
                cups-genppdupdate, you do not need to do this
