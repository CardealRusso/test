Comments:       Frr is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based                                     
                routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1,                                   
                RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.                                          
                Frr also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.                         
                In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Frr also supports                             
                IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and                                 
                AgentX protocol, Frr provides routing protocol MIBs.
