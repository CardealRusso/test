Comments:       Designed for programmers with large heterogeneous trees of source
                code, ack is written in portable Perl 5 and takes advantage of
                the power of Perl's regular expressions. ack is designed as an
                alternative to grep for programmers. ack searches the named input
                FILEs or DIRECTORYs for lines containing a match to the given
                PATTERN. By default, ack prints the matching lines. If no FILE or
                DIRECTORY is given, the current directory will be searched.
                ack searches recursively by default, while ignoring .git, .svn,
                CVS and other VCS directories.
