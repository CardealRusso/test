Extension_by: 	PDP-8
Tags:		font fixed-width bitmap  
Comments:	Especially useful for lightweight systems running only Xvesa
		or Xfbdev, although full Xorg is fine too. Supports a HUGE 
		amount of characters and localizations. 
                 
                Included: 6x12, 8x14, 8x16, 10x18, 10x20, 11x22, 12x24, 14x28,
                and 16x32

                Weights: normal and bold (except for 6x12) 

		Installation:
		Edit ~/.xsession to add new fonts to path:
		xset fp+ /usr/local/share/fonts/terminus/
		xset fp rehash

		Log out and back in. (Exit to prompt)
		Run xlsfonts to get a list of long and short names.

		Usage:
		Temporary from existing terminal - use short name ie,
		aterm -fn terminus-18 &
		(an alias is handy here)

		Permanent - edit your ~/.Xdefaults and use the long name, ie
		Aterm*font: -xos4-terminus-bold-r-normal--20-200-72-72-c
		-100-iso8859-1

		Hint: dont miss the -- "double-dash" !!
