                 Normal builtin keys link below
                 https://vifm.info/cheatsheets.shtml
                 Copying to buffer/Selecting dir or file is called 
                 yanking hence yy (yanks), in command mode 
                 its the same as :yank  
                 Normally followed by a delete or paste input 

                 and doc TCE, especially vifm-help.txt

                 Run 2 panes by  $ vifm /dir1 /dir2 # like mc
                 On restart it may remember your last dirs so 
                 :cd /dir3 /dir4 # will change to new dirs  

                 In a virtual terminal, mc function keys like 
                 F3,4,5,6,8 work as expected except
                 F3 opens vi for inline view (unless configs changed)
                 F4 opens vi for edits and both will need input of 
                 quit view by :q  or save and quit edit by :wq 

                 In Console, Function keys fail (for me) -> use vi commands only
                 I use arrow keys to highlight selection dir or file, and eg
                 :copy (will copy dir or file to other directory )
                 :copy (force over write if exists at other dir)
               
                 You may like to edit the config file?
                 It is not created until you launch vifm. Next
                 $ rm -rf $HOME/.config/vifm/vifmrc 
                 $ cp /tmp/tcloop/vifm/usr/local/share/vifm/vifmrc $HOME/.config/vifm
                 
                 You can use external GUI TCES like leafpad too
                 To completely exit file manager while in normal mode...input  ZZ (all caps)
                 or convert to command mode and input :q 

                 In normal mode input : puts you into command mode, normally followed by letter(s)
