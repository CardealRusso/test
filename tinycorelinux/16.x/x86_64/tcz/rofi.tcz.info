                An X11 & (X)wayland pop-up window switcher, run dialog, 
                dmenu replacement. It supports keyboard & mouse 
                navigation, type to filter, tokenized search 
                and log into a remote machine via ssh. (Untested)
                
                config = $HOME/.config/rofi/config.rasi
                You should correct pathway to theme if not user=tc
                PLUS you have 1xtheme file
                $HOME/.config/rofi/themes/fancy.rasi
                which is called by last line in your config file
                
                NORMAL USE: 
                If not using wbar icon, run 
                $ rofi -show drun -show-icons
                Scroll thru selections via arrow key or mouse
                Press enter against selection to open it
                If App is already open elsewhere, you may switch to it 
                --- subject to WM settings
                Press Escape key to exit app if no selection made.
                OR mouse click outside app to exit
                (change config for click-to-exit if you like app open if 
                 you need to swap workspaces for a while)
                Highly recommend you create a keybinding for above in WM,
                if WM allows kb shortcuts

                Selection + Enter key opens "target app" and closes rofi

                If your WM supports workspaces, $ rofi -show window
                provides a list of what is open on each workspace

                To run it like dmenu (exe search not a desktop file search) 
                $ rofi -show run 
                but note the following enhancements, IMHO,
                string search is anywhere in exe name
                eg search for "gr" without quotes has hits including
                addgroup, groff,  vigr etc

                fancy theme includes tabs for windows etc
 
                TESTED basic functions on icewm/xorg and sway/xwayland 
                rofi on wayland likely to bork if xwayland not loaded and enabled 
                See rofi-doc & rofi-theme-selector
