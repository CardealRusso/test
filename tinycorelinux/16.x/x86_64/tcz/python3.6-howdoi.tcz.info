Comments:	Are you a hack programmer? Do you find yourself constantly Googling how to do
		basic programming tasks?
		Suppose you want to know how to format a date in bash. Why open your browser and read
		through blogs (risking major distraction) when you can simply stay in the console
		and ask howdoi:

		$ howdoi format date bash
		> DATE=`date +%Y-%m-%d`

		howdoi will answer all sorts of queries

		New to howdoi ?
		$ howdoi howdoi
