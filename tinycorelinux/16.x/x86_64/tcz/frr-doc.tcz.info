Comments:       Frr is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based
                routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1,
                RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.
                Frr also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.
                In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Frr also supports
                IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and
                AgentX protocol, Frr provides routing protocol MIBs.

                Configuration examples can now be found online at:
