                Your active App is the last loaded app on your current workspace.
                OR its the one with the blue titlebar. 

                If you change ~/.config/sway/config, run from within sway 
                (Windows logo key) + z (see config ) --and check for  
                errors appearing at top of monitor.

                First use
                ##########
                Download this App and sway-dot, then load sway-dot
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot
                Exit to prompt and run 
                $  z  
                Later Uses, no need to load sway-dot 
                                             
                Exit Sway 
                #########
                press logo + e  -> will launch exittc

                Conflicting TCE=wbar, after testing, if you like sway,
                remove wbar as it interferes with sway please

                Optional dependencies 
                ##################
                - Changeable or removeable- leafpad.
                - Changeable - lxterminal but make sure you modify and test config please,
                  as you need a terminal set.
                - grim and slurp (take screenshots)
                - dmenu  (a launcher. Must have xwayland loaded and enabled)
                - wl-clipboard (terminal clipboard manager if not using a 
                              terminal with copy and paste support)
                - swaylock (lock screen read its info please)
                - swayidle ( with settings in config)
                - Removeable dep = sway-wallpapers but read its info on how to 
                   change to your own please
                - xwayland allows most apps to run on wayland.
                

                You can not use logo + l (or) r as these interfere with 
                shortcuts with logo + left (<- arrow) to shift focus to
                App left of current active app. Ditto right (-> arrow)
                Which is why leafpad can not use logo + l
                
                Known gremlins 
                ###############
                1) in sway for sudo su users,
                   command echo $PATH gives a reduced set of pathways 
                   to executables---so run
                   $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin

                2) Going from sway -> prompt -> startx
                   local user loses full pathway too! same fix as above
                   $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
                   Note I do not use ondemand

                3) If you launch an app that would normally appear in wbar, and wbar is loaded
                   wbar interferes with sway -> $ pkill wbar before loading them
