Comments:       A scrolling, platform-jumping, key-collecting, ancient pyramid 
                exploring game, vaguely in the style of similar games for the Commodore+4. 

                (arrow keys=move)  (esc=quit)  (enter=use a balloon)
                space = jump  OR toggle some settings in the settings screen
 
                Optional TCE input-joystick-6.6.8-tinycore64  not tested

                Suggest setup sound first.  First find a wav file. If 
                $ aplay /usr/local/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav
                plays a noise you are good to go. If you have been
                using pulse to swap your devices, you may like to try
                https://tinyurl.com/disablehdmi if you need analog sound.
                If sound too difficult to setup
                run $ abe --nosound
               
                $ abe -t # tests video modes available
                If you are not using FM -> desktop files to launch nor
                wbar launchers....try  $ abe 

                GREMLIN, Settings -> space toggle to easy or hard fails for me,
                ditto some other settings.
