"Comments:	Frr is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based"
                routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1,
                RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.
                Frr also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.
                In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Frr also supports
                IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and
                AgentX protocol, Frr provides routing protocol MIBs.

                Configuration examples can now be found online at:
                http://docs.frrouting.org

                The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
                If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-netfilter-x.x.x-tinycore.tcz via
                the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-netfilter-KERNEL).
                If you want to make use of namespaces install iproute2.tcz via
                the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi iproute2).

                The startup script is located at /usr/local/sbin/frrinit.sh.
                You can configure the routing protocol daemons  to start in file:
                /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons.
                If not present cp /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons.sample to
                /usr/local/etc/frr/daemons and enable to protocols to use.
                Use the startup script with "sudo frrinit.sh" <options>.
                Usage:
                sudo frrinit.sh { start | stop | restart | force-reload | status | reload } [namespace]
                The reload option is to reload a configuration file without restarting the daemons.

                After the enabled daemons are running you can login with:
                vtysh

                The install script can help to do the basic setup of FRR.
                By default it will prepare FRR to use vtysh (one configuration for all daemons).
                If you don't want the install script to do the basic setup for you,
                you can disable it with creating a file NOSETUPHELP in /tmp 
                (touch /tmp/NOSETUPHELP) before installation.

                Watchfrr, a daemon monitoring connectivity with routing daemons,
                is enabled by default.
