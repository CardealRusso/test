Comments:       For those who need to run nano as root, read your
                .nanorc and if you like to, copy your .nanorc to
                /root/.nanorc  and edit as per suggestions inside file starts line 230
                To persist over reboot, add that to your backup please
                
                New keyboard bindings (also affects nanorc)
                #####################
                ^ manual symbol = Ctrl key
                M manual symbol = is the Meta key = Alt key   

                $ nano --modernbindings <pathway2/file> 
                Ctrl + (x/c/v/z) cuts/copies/pastes/undo <at cursor postion>
                Ctrl + (q/w/o/r) quits/writes/opens/replace
              
                Many more as per https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html
                Plus doc TCE has lots of new stuff. Due to these changes I suggest you 
                read the new doc TCE please

                Watch out for delete, it deletes entire line at cursor position!
                Paste does not paste external buffer only internal copy to nano
                Your window manager keybindings may also affect nano
