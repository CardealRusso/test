Comments:       Load any required wifi device firmware, usb modules (if usb)
                before wicd. Recommend you load wireless-regdb too + see its info.
                GUI fails to disconnect/connect ethernet instead
                $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down 
                $ sudo ifconfig eth0 up 
                $ sudo udhcpc -i eth0
              
                Please restart dbus irrespective of current state. (Unless automating 
                below). If not, expect dbus connection errors.  Software that depends 
                on dbus eg large web browser may also need restart (not reboot). YMMV

                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/wicd start

                Ways to open GUI:
                -- menu -> Network (or System)  -> Wicd 
                -- click icon in file manager for /usr/share/applications/Wicd*
                -- $ wicd-gtk --tray (or --no-tray)
                -- Assign keybindings if your desktop supports them.
                Note no harm in using --tray on desktops that have no panel support.
                eg hackedbox fvwm etc

                These methods attempt to put a tray into your panel, if you are
                running a DE/WM that supports gtk2 applets eg icewm
                I assume right handed mouse user: (reverse for lefties please)
                -- left click opens GUI
                -- mouse hover -> should show the connection and LAN address
                -- right click -> connection info -> shows speed and data 
                -- right click -> connect... may attempt to autoconnect to your
                   neighbour if you are not paying attention.

                For menu or left click applet -> gtk2 GUI should open.
                Against router name, click on properties -> pulldown encryption method 
                and choose method, likely WPA 1/2 passphrase
                Input passsphrase in box below
                Click on connect & wait -> must say "connected" at bottom of GUI
                
                If you wish to backup over reboot 
                add these to /opt/.filetool.lst
                usr/local/etc/wicd
                var/lib/wicd/configurations
               
                If you wish to automate over reboot add these to /opt/bootlocal.sh (tested)
                /usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus start
                /usr/local/etc/init.d/wicd start
                Note here dbus does not need a restart.
                
                TCE=python-urwid is broken due to a ncursesw issue
                so wicd-curses has been removed from this TCE
                TCE for wicd-doc offers things like 
                $ man wicd-wireless-settings.conf
                
Change-log:     2016/03/13 v 1.7.4 (Juanito)

Current:        2024/10/23 rebuilt on 15x - changed initid script - no install script (aus9)
