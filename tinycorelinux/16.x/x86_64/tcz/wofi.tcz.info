Comments:       For labwc or sway  - 3 built in modes

                run  - searches $PATH for executables and allows them 
                       to be run by selecting them.
                drun - searches $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications and 
                       $XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications for desktop files and 
                       allows them to be run by selecting them.
                dmenu - reads from stdin and displays options which when selected 
                        will be output to stdout.
                        Unable to get third mode working YMMV

                $ wofi -S run   -> displays a list of executables without needing dmenu
                $ wofi -S drun  -> displays desktop file executables without showing icons  
                $ wofi -S drun  -I  -> displays desktop executables and their icons # that I for India 

                While wofi (popup) is open, keyboard locked to wofi until you 
                press Escape key to exit wofi OR arrow down to a selection and 
                press enter to launch your selection OR type in search box, a 
                command which reduces display of results, press enter against that selection.

                Normal search are case sensitive even if -M=fuzzy used.
                eg input le, results include leafpad, less, filetool.sh
                eg input LE -> no results even if fuzzy used
