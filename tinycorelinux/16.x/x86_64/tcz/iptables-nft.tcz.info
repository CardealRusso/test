                Install script restores /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
                Which until you change it, is a copy of 
                /usr/local/share/iptables/rules/iptables.rules and not the
                empty ip6tables.rules. If you need to change it, you delete the 
                /etc file and make a file with the exact same path and name
                /etc/iptables/iptables.rules and then add that file to your backup
                (Dropping the leading /) Even tho I am not an expert I believe most
                members will get by just fine with this ip v4 ruleset

                Check current ruleset with $ sudo iptables -L

                Test any changed ruleset by running 
                $ sudo iptables-restore /etc/iptables/iptables.rules
                $ sudo iptables -L

                I recommend you test online testers EXAMPLE ONLY
                https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?rh1dkyd2
                Bear in mind you may already have a router firewall and some
                network providers may block some ports
