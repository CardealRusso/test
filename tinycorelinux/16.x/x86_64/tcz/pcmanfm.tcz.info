                Config will auto-create at ~/.config/pcmanfm/default/pcmanfm.conf
                Original /etc/xdg/pcmanfm/pcmanfm.conf

                Change by pulldown Edit -> Preferences.
                If pcmanfm run in desktop mode, other preferences can be activated
                see   https://tinyurl.com/y3ouvb94
                Recommend change preferences to not allow volume management automount
                of volumes on startup. 
                FM preferences can also change libfm (dependency) config.
                            
                FM Bookmarks at ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks 
                FM can integrate with some archive TCEs but no dependencies set
                See /usr/local/share/libfm/archivers.list
                load one then run $ update-desktops

                This build has no support for:
                pulldown Edit -> move to trash but context menu on a file/dir will offer delete
                pulldown Go -> Trash can, devices, Network or server 

                Optional TCES - search for theme in Apps & lxappearance
                Download and load your preferred theme and run $ lxappearance 
                ->  creates  ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
                Desktop themes might interfere, you be the judge.
                I like skeuos-gtk-themes.tcz mainly supports gtk2 & 3
