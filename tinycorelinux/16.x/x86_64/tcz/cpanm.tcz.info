                DEPENDENCIES will be seen in log if install fails
                eg  sudo su && cpanm Glib
                log at /root/.cpanm/build.log 
                (snip) Package gobject-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path  
                (so) load  gobject-introspection-dev and repeat install command 
                (build.log will change and old build.log will be under ..work)

                To check what modules you have installed,  I run
                $ instmodsh
                (prompt changes to cmd? <input l to list or q to quit> 

                If you have to package something, please check the build log as it
                shows what was installed and where eg
                Installing /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.26.1/\
                x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/Glib/Glib.so   and others 
 
                Compiled for 9.x
