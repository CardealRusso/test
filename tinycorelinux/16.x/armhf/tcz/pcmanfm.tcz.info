                mime types include txt mp3 mp4 pdf html and so on
                On first load, pcmanfm attempts to update some mimes
                But you may load a TCE after pcmanfm, in which case try
                $ update-desktops
                No need to restart pcmanfm, either new TCE app appears
                to open mime type or not
