                Only some basic drivers are included in TCE
                Most drivers are in gutenprint or hplip 

                howto
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start
                the root password needs to be set as root owns /usr/local/etc/cups
                $ sudo passwd
                At some stage in the process below use root and root password 
                Ensure popups allowed in your web browser.

                http://localhost:631/admin will start the browser interface
                Click "add printer" (not find) and follow the prompts
                To persist across boots, add the following to your backup 
                (but remove leading "/" s). --- PPD are examples only
                No need to backup something.ppd.0
                /usr/local/etc/cups/ppd/HP_DeskJet_2600_series.ppd 
                /usr/local/etc/cups/ppd/Canon_MG3000_series.ppd
                /usr/local/etc/cups/printers.conf
                /usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf (only if you changed it)
                
                Most likely these are already backed up but if not there, 
                add to backup please 
                /etc/group # contains lp group for printing
                /etc/gshadow
                /etc/passwd
                /etc/shadow 

                Cups root session password is more flexible. Unless you change
                config files, you do not need to use the same root password you
                originally used to setup the printer(s). As long as you input the
                current root password in the popup, configs should be edittable.
