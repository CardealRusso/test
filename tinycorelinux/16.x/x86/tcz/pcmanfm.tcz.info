                Config will auto-create at ~/.config/pcmanfm/default/pcmanfm.conf
                Original /etc/xdg/pcmanfm/pcmanfm.conf

                Change by pulldown Edit -> Preferences.
                If pcmanfm run in desktop mode, other preferences can be activated

                Config changed on update to disable auto mount of your partitions. 
                Use mnttool or command to umount as gvfs or udisks not enabled this build. 

                FM preferences can also change libfm (dependency) config.
                FM Bookmarks at ~/.gtk-bookmarks 
                gvfs and trash can support disabled. 

                FM can integrate with an archiver but no dependencies set. 
                If you load a GUI TCE after pcmanfm then run $ update-desktops 
                However some files need icon theme and lxappearance might perform
                setup easier than manual edit of $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0.mine
