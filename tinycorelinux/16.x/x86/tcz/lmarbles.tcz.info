Comments:       LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in concept.
		Instead of assembling molecules you create figures out of marbles. 
		Nevertheless, the basic game play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will not stop 
		until it hits a wall or another marble. To make it more interesting there are obstacles 
		like one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals.
		As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against a move limit and not a time limit.
		This way you have as much time as you need to think.
