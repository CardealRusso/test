Comments:       Contains the plan9-install.sh script to generate plan9
                extensions, either from an existing plan9port tree or
                installing the latest version from github
                ----
                To create plan9.tcz: plan9-install.sh
                For more help:       plan9-install.sh -h

                it tries to load a plan9-local or plan9 extension
