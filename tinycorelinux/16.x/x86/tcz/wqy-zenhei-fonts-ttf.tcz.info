                The WenQuanYi Zen Hei font is a Chinese (or CJK) outline font 
                with Hei-Ti style (a sans-serif style) Hanzi glyphs. This font
                is developed for general purpose use of Chinese for formating,
                printing and on-screen display

                The Authors disabled the embedded bitmaps, so that the characters 
                will be displayed as Anti-aliased glyphs. 

                You should set up locale and also load TCEs that are locales, 
                eg load lxterminal-locale not lxterminal
