Comments:	To compile this on Linux smal changes had to be 
		made (remove some const declarations) and lua 
		had to be disabled due to incompatible versions 
		(for libubox run: cmake CMakeLists.txt -DBUILD_LUA=OFF)

		compiled against and delivered with libubox, openwrt stuff.

		be careful with usb_modeswitch, one of it's scripts 
		requires tclsh to be in the right path.

		Example:
		sudo uqmi --device=/dev/cdc-wdm0 --keep-client-id wds --start-network my.apn --autoconnect

		As I'm now getting connected automatically all that's left
		is to get IP running with: sudo udhcpc -i wwan0
