                Troubleshooting:
                If nothing happens, here're some common solutions
                * Environment variables (VERY IMPORTANT)
                "log out" then "log in" to reset the environment variables
                Type "echo $XIM" in the terminal to varify if it's "ibus"
                Please refer to /etc/profile.d/ibus.sh in ibus.tcz
                * ibus-daemon didn't start
                When "ibus engine" gives you error messages
                Type "ibus-daemon -drx -n openbox" to start the daemon
                * Select Input Method
                Press <Super> + <Space> to switch input method
                Or run the GUI tool, ibus-setup, to change the setting
                ----------
                For more details, please refer to the documents
                Check ~/.X.d/ibus-chewing and adjust the script for your machine
                Or /usr/local/share/doc/ibus-chewing/startup_script.example
