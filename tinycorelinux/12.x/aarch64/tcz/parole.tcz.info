                home config is 
                ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/parole.xml
                
                AUDIO - Set up Alsa first, Read apulse for 
                analog users on how to swap index.
                               
                VIDEO (I own a RPi 4 My suggested config )
                mount partition 1 and edit config.txt so it reads
                [pi4]
                dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d-pi4
                max_framebuffers=1
                gpu_mem=256
                hdmi_enable_4kp60=1
                (full reboot)
                
                If RAM less than 1G see
                https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/memory.md
                RPi 3 users may need to vary config options YMMV

                Video sub-titles not tested. You may need more fonts.
                
                If you load xscreensaver, $ killall xscreensaver

                Fullscreen mp4 on large monitors more likely to glitch/drop frames
                On my 22 inch, my AAC encoded mp4 file, full screen causes jerky
                unwatchable video. With above settings plays OK with resized 
                18 inch window.
