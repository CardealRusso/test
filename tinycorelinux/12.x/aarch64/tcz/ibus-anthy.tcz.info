                Before you start, add "lang=ja_JP.utf8" in your boot code
                * Download and run getlocale.tcz, select ja_JP.utf8 and install
                * Fetch any font that support UTF-8 (ex: unifont.tcz)
                * Load this extension
                * Start openbox or jwm
                * Switch EN/JP with keyboard: <Ctrl> + <J>
                You should be able to type japanese now, enjoy ~ !
                ----------
                Troubleshooting:
                If nothing happens, here're some common solutions
                * Environment variables (VERY IMPORTANT)
                "log out" then "log in" to reset the environment variables
                 ( Kill the X server, type exit in prompt, log-in as tc )
                Type "echo $XIM" in the terminal to varify if it's "ibus"
                Please refer to /etc/profile.d/ibus.sh in ibus.tcz
                * ibus-daemon didn't start
                When "ibus engine" gives you error messages
                Type "ibus-daemon -drx -n openbox" to start the daemon
                * Select Input Method
                Press <Super> + <Space> to switch input method
                Or run the GUI tool, ibus-setup, to change the setting
                ----------
                For more details, please refer to the documents
                Check ~/.X.d/ibus-anthy and adjust the script for your machine
                Or /usr/local/share/doc/ibus-anthy/startup_script.example
                ----------
                Maintainer note:
                I don't speak Japanese.
                If anyone is interested in maintaining the packages.
                Feel free to take over.
