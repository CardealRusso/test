Comments:	MWM is one of the earliest window managers for X.

		Default configuration is in:
		/usr/local/lib/X11/system.mwmrc
		Copy to ~/.mwmrc and edit to add menu items etc.
		Examples can be seen here:
		http://www.xwinman.org/mwm.php

		.desktop files installed with extensions are not
		handled automatically to add new menu items.

		Though originally proprietary software, Motif and
		MWM were released under an open-source licence
		in 2012.
