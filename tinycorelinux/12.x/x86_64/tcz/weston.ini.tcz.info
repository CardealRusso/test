Comments:       The current weston TCE has no weston.ini
                This install script attempts to create one
                with mainly gnome apps. Do not have this in your 
                onboot list please. Designed to be run once.
                $ tce-load -i weston.ini

                After loading, edit .config/weston.ini to suit what apps you
                prefer to run instead.

                Be aware that you will get an icon that looks like
                X 
                if you have not loaded that app for a particular boot.

                fltk or gtk1/2 apps will neeed xwayland loaded to run them.
                The last icon is for exittc so likely to appear as X as its FLTK based.
