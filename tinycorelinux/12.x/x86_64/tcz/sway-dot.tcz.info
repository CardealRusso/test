Comments:       startx is used to start a X WM while sway runs 
                on Wayland so to allow people to try sway I 
                have elected to give them a dot local bin file 
                ..z..to use at console prompt to launch sway

                See sway TCE info on how to exit sway and then 
                you can run startx to start your preferred DE/WM,
                if you do not like sway.

                That means this app is a DownloadOnly and not to be 
                added to your boot list file. It is run once by 
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot

                I have attempted to put a help.txt file under
                ~/.config/sway which will autostart with sway 

                sway-dot can be loaded without sway loaded.
