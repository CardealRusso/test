Comments:       While it does not seek to mirror all of find's powerful
                functionality, it provides sensible defaults for 80% of
                the use cases.
                Features
                    Convenient syntax: fd PATTERN instead of find -iname '*PATTERN*'.
                    Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
                    Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default.
                      It switches to case-sensitive if the pattern contains
                      an uppercase character*.
                    Regular expressions.
                    Unicode-awareness.
                    Parallel command execution with a syntax similar to
                      GNU Parallel.
