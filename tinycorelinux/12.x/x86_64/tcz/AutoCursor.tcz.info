		AutoCursor controls cursor visibility based on device
		events, such as mouse, keyboard, touch screen, etc.

		Usage: AutoCursor [-sN] [-hN] [-i] [-e] [-S file] [-A] [-L file]

			-s N    Show cursor when event N occurs.
			-h N    Hide cursor when event N occurs.
			-i      Initial state of cursor is hidden.
			-e      Display list of available events with descriptions.
			-S file Save event settings to file.
			-A      Append instead of overwrite when -S is used.
			-L file Load event settings from file.

		Example: sudo AutoCursor -i -s5 -h1 -h3 -s2 -S ~/.cursor.conf &

		Starts with cursor hidden.
		Shows cursor when events 5 or 2 occur.
		Hides cursor when events 1 or 3 occur.
		Saves the event settings (but not -i) to a file.


		To start automatically next time you boot:
		echo "sudo AutoCursor -i -L ~/.cursor.conf &" > ~/.X.d/AutoCursor

		Event numbers can change between boots by adding or removing a
		mouse for example. So settings get saved by description instead.
		If a mouse was included in your saved settings and is not present
		when you boot, we just move on to the next setting in the file.

		Built with:
		CFLAGS=-flto -fuse-linker-plugin -mtune=generic -Os -g -pipe -Wall -Wextra -fno-plt
		LDFLAGS=-Wl,-T/usr/local/lib/ldscripts/elf_x86_64.xbn
