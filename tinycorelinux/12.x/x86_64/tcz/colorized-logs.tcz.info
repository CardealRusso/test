Comments:       Here's a handful of tools for dealing with logs with ANSI
                color. Some tools like gcc, dmesg, grep --color, colordiff,
                ccze, etc can enhance their output with color, making
                reading a lot more pleasant.  The difference can be as big
                as between slogging through twenty pages of a build log to
                find a failure, and a swift drag of the scroller to do the
                same within a second. Such colored logs can be usually
                viewed on a terminal or with "less -R"; this package gives
                you:
                    * ansi2html: convert logs to HTML
                      usage: ansi2html < input > output.html
                    * ansi2txt: drop ANSI control codes
                    * ttyrec2ansi: drop timing data from ttyrec files
                    * pipetty: makes a program think its stdout and stderr
                      are connected to a terminal; use as a prefix: "pipetty
                      dmesg|tee"
