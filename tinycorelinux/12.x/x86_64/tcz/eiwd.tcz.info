 BASIC USAGE:
  - How to connect to password-protected hotspot: 
     $ printf "[Security]\nPassphrase=PASSWORD\n" | sudo tee /var/lib/iwd/SSID.psk
     $ sudo iwd -i IFACE &
     $ sudo udhcpc -i IFACE
  - How to connect to open (passwordless) hotspot:
     $ sudo touch /var/lib/iwd/SSID.open
     $ sudo iwd -i IFACE &
     $ sudo udhcpc -i IFACE
  - Example usage:
     $ printf "[Security]\nPassphrase=Secret123\n" | sudo tee /var/lib/iwd/HomeSweetHome.psk
     $ sudo iwd -i wlan0 &
     $ sudo udhcpc -i wlan0
  - To disconnect from hotspot: 
     $ sudo pkill -f iwd
  - Note: The warning about missing CONFIG_KEY_DH_OPERATIONS is benign
 ADVANCED USAGE:
  - General settings go in /etc/iwd/main.conf, ssid-specific settings go in 
    /var/lib/iwd/SSID.open or /var/lib/iwd/SSID.psk as appropriate
  - iwd connects to best-quality hotspot among those in /var/lib/iwd/. To force
    connection to a specific hotspot when several are within range, do
    "sudo rm /var/lib/iwd/*" before step 1 of basic usage
  - Note about dhcp and dns: eiwd has a built-in dhcp client (disabled by 
    default) which requires resolvconf or openresolv to manage dns settings. If
    you prefer to enable eiwd's dhcp client (via 
    "[General]\nEnableNetworkConfiguration=true" in /etc/iwd/main.conf) rather 
    than use udhcpc, then you'll either need to load openresolv.tcz or else 
    manually edit /etc/resolv.conf--for example: 
     $ echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
