Comments:       You must NOT load sway on a libX or Xorg desktop as 
                your desktop "should" crash...... Online wiki is here
                https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki
                Note the wiki also mentions polkit matters. I have US keyboard,  
                read the sway-doc for other inputs please.

                This wayland desktop might suit those who do not mind 
                reading the config and using keyboard combinations (kb combos) 
                to launch their fav apps. Kb combos tend to be faster than mouse, 
                but you may need a mouse to exit sway.

                If you change ~/.config/sway/config,  run from within sway
                $ sway -C (to check its correct)

                FIRST TIME USE
                ###############
                Download this App and sway-dot, then load sway-dot
                $ tce-load -i sway-dot
                Install script also adds memory.txt to config dir. 

                VIDEO DRIVERS
                #############
                Closed source drivers are not supported by sway. 
                 
                How to start Sway
                ###########
                Exit to console prompt and run
                $  z                 

                Running Sway
                ############
                Read the auto started help.txt file in sway.

                If you do not need a mouse, edit your home config line so it reads
                bindsym $mod+Shift+e exec swaymsg exit

                Optional dependencies
                ##################
                grim and slurp (take screenshots)
                dmenu  (a launcher. Must have xwayland loaded and enabled)
                wl-clipboard (terminal clipboard manager if not using a 
                terminal with copy and paste support)
                leafpad can be removed from dep file if you prefer something else.
                Ditto sakura but make sure you modify and test config please.
          
                quick guide to change resolution and speed
                ######################################
                $ swaymsg -t get_outputs
                (look at output  ---mine defaults to highest  resolution @ 60Hz
                and modify the config file with my example showing)
                output HDMI-A-2 mode 1280x1024@75Hz
                (exit sway and re-start it then repeat get outputs command)

                Other info
                ########
                I recommend not removing # against xwayland line until you know
                what will be the consequences for any non-wayland supported app.
                xwayland allows most apps to run on wayland.
                
                How I use sway  YMMV
                Method A: You can "auto" launch more apps on WS 1 instead of creating 
                keybindings and then use move kb combos to move them to preferred 
                WS numbers eg I use a specific workspace for terminal, another 
                for web browser etc. 

                Method B: use kb combo to create and move focus to WS 2 
                = logo +2 ...use config "created" kb keybinding to launch a TCE
                then move to workspace 3...and launch your fav TCE
                IMHO Method A is faster. 

                I recommend you remove wbar, from boot list, if you like sway.
