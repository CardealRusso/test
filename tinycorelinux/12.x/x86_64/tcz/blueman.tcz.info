                ----------
                Howto:
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/bluez start
                $ startx
                use blueman to manage bluetooth connections
                ----------
                whilst audio might work with alsa, it is much easier to configure with pulseaudio/pavucontrol
                ----------
                no longer requires obexd or obex-data-server for file transfer
                requires locale set to en_US.UTF-8 or similar to receive files
                ----------
                receive file location, the use of networkmanager and/or notification-daemon
                can be set with view plugins/system settings menu or dconf-editor/gsettings
