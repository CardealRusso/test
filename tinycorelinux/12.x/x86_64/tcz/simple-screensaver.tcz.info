Comments: ----------
  - The script takes no arguments. To start it with default settings, simply do:
      $ simple-screensaver &
  - To change the default settings, edit ~/.config/simple-screensaver.conf
  - If you change the config file while the script is running, send USR1 signal
    to the script for it to reload the config file, like this:
      $ pkill -USR1 -f simple-screensaver
  - To manually trigger animations to start, send USR2 signal:
      $ pkill -USR2 -f simple-screensaver
  - Normally you should only have to change two settings: "idle" (how many 
    seconds system should be idle before screensaver starts) and "cycle" (how 
    many seconds to play an animation before switching to a different one)
  - Use cycle=0 if you don't want animation to change once it starts
  - Comment-out all but a single line in the command file if you want a specific
    animation instead of a random one
  - Any command that produces an animation or image can be included in the
    command file; the command can be in animation_dir or anywhere in your PATH
  - Caveat: Your window manager needs to be EWMH/NetWM-compatible in order for 
    the script to work as intended; ultra-minimalistic window managers such as 
    flwm are not compatible (see http://tripie.sweb.cz/utils/wmctrl)
