Comments:	The hidraw back-end uses the hidraw interface in the Linux kernel.  While this
		back-end will support both USB and Bluetooth, it has some limitations on
		kernels prior to 2.6.39, including the inability to send or receive feature
		reports.  In addition, it will only communicate with devices which have
		hidraw nodes associated with them.  Keyboards, mice, and some other devices
		which are blacklisted from having hidraw nodes will not work. Fortunately,
		for nearly all the uses of hidraw, this is not a problem.
