Comments:	nnn (or n³) is a full-featured terminal file manager. It's tiny and nearly 0-config with
		an incredible performance.

		nnn can analyze disk usage, batch rename, launch apps and pick files. The plugin repository
		has tons of plugins and documentation to extend the capabilities further e.g. preview
		hovered, (un)mount disks, find & list, file/dir diff, upload files.
		There's an independent (neo)vim plugin.
