Comments:	----------
    - for eject button, you need either yad.tcz (and some kind of panel) or wbar.tcz
    - user settings go in ~/.config/usb-automount.conf
    - usb-automount.conf should have these four lines in any order:
        mount_dir=/mnt # or /media or any directory you want
        file_manager=xfe # change to whatever GUI file manager you use
        icon=/usr/local/share/icons/usb-automount/eject.png # or any other icon
        icon_method=wbar # must be either wbar or yad
