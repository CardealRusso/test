                My config.txt reads (I have one output)
                [pi4]
                dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d-pi4
                max_framebuffers=1
                gpu_mem=256
                hdmi_enable_4kp60=1
                -> full reboot
                
                If RAM less than 1G see
                https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/memory.md
                Video sub-titles not tested. You may need more fonts.
                
                If you load xscreensaver, $ killall xscreensaver

                Fullscreen mp4 on large monitors more likely to glitch/drop frames
                On a 22 inch monitor, my nastiest AAC encoded mp4 file, plays OK with 13.5 inch GUI
                but 16 inch on aarch64 for same file. Non-AAC encoded seem to play ok at 16 inch
