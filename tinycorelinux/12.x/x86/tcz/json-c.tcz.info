Comments:       JSON-C - A JSON implementation in C
                JSON-C implements a reference counting object model that allows
                you to easily construct JSON objects in C, output them as JSON
                formatted strings and parse JSON formatted strings back into the C
                representation of JSON objects. It aims to conform to RFC 7159.
