                ----------
                From tc-5.x onwards, it appears that loading the alsa extension is
                sufficient to initialise sound.
                You will need to use alsamixer to un-mute the master volume control.
                if this doesn't work, try loading alsa-config before loading the alsa extension
                ----------
                The graphics-KERNEL extension might be required if your hardware provides hdmi
                ----------
		If you want your alsa settings to persist across reboots, use the
		command "sudo alsactl store" after alsa has been set up and
                add /usr/local/etc/alsa/asound.state to your backup
                if alsa is loaded onboot you may need "sudo alsactl restore"
                ----------
                alsaloop requires the libsamplerate extension.
                ----------
