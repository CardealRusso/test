                lafilecopier was written by me(justincb) to deal with the
                fact that tcz packages are mounted readonly. It copies the
                .la files into the ramfs
                
                Some packages cannot be built with libtool because some
                packages don't have libtool libraries. This extension allows
                this to be fixed by changing references to nonexistent libtool
                libraries to the non-libtool libraries. To use-
                sudo lafilecopier
                sudo lafilefixer /usr/local/lib
