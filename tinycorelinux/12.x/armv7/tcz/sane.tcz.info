                Avoiding damage on flatbed scanners
                Some flatbed scanners have no protection against 
                exceeding the physical scan area height. If scanner begins 
                making loud noises IMMEDIATELY turn off the scanner.

                Security problems with saned is not intended to be exposed 
                to the internet or other non-trusted networks.  Make sure 
                that access is limited by tcpwrappers and/or a firewall setup. 
                Do not depend only on saned  own authentication.  Do not run saned
                as root if it is not necessary

                If not using hplip, 
                $ scanimage -o /tmp/scan.jpg
                Tested with usb canon, you may need avahi or net-snmp if you have non-usb?

                If error for above check
                $ scanimage -L # must show a hit SNIP means I truncated output 
                eg device pixma:04A9180B_0581C8 is a CANON (SNIP)
                Then check internet
