Comments:       The daemon for making PPP connections.
		This includes dialup, PPPoE, and other kinds
		of PPP such as connections over a serial cable.
-		The config files are *not* in /usr/local,
		as they are hardcoded to /etc/ppp in the sources.
		If you make any changes to these files, you might
		want to add /etc/ppp to your backup.
