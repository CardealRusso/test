Comments:       My File Manager Re-Imagined is a quirky, fast, light file
                manager that uses FLTK v1.1.10. Based on the now dormant
                MFM v0.4 with numerous bug fixes and features.

                MFMR is configurable and contains helper executables to find
                files, mount partitions, check freespace, rename, extract
                and compress files. Click Help! for changelog, bug fixes
                and user guide.
