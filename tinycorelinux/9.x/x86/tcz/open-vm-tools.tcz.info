		----
		Download and install in console before reboot; do not install while in X.
		Use /usr/local/etc/init.d/open-vm-tools (e.g. /opt/bootlocal.sh) to control vmtoolsd service
		Shared folders should mount during login. If not run:
			[ $(which vmware-checkvm) ] && [ vmware-checkvm ] && [ -d /mnt/hgfs ] && vmhgfs-fuse /mnt/hgfs
		Kernel modules removed, now all tools are userspace.
		Verify permissions for /dev/fuse are 1666.
		Loading the extension should create /mnt/hgfs. Verify that it happened and the permissions are 777.
		Files in shared folders will not be visible to anyone other than the user that
			mounts them, including root. This is why if the shared folders are mounted
			in a directory that is in a tree in /opt/.filetool.lst, backups will fail.
		Xorg and its dependencies are not needed for text only VM's.
