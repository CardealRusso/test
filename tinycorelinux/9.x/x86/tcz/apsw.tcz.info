Comments:       The file is called an i686 file, but it used the
                default python build arguments for tinycore,
                which are -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -O3 -pipe
Change-log:     2017/09/26 Compiled from source for tinycore 8.x
Current:        2017/09/26 Compiled from source for tinycore 8.x
