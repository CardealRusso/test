Comments:       The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to develop
                the SeaMonkey Internet Application Suite. Such a suite
                was previously made popular by Netscape and Mozilla.
                It contains an Internet browser, email & newsgroup
                client with an included web feed reader, HTML editor,
                IRC chat and web development tools. SeaMonkey uses
                much of the Mozilla Firefox source code.
