		Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely
		built from its own, independently developed source that has been
		forked off from Firefox/Mozilla code a number of years ago, with
		carefully selected features and optimizations to improve the
		browser's stability and user experience, while offering full
		customization and a growing collection of extensions and themes to
		make the browser truly your own.

		uses GTK2 instead of GTK3
