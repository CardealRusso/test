Comments:       Full name=Nimbus Sans L, which includes regular and bold weight 
                fonts in all widths and styles, were released under the GPL, 
                and is one of several freely licensed fonts offered by URW++.

                Although the characters are not exactly the same, Nimbus Sans L 
                has metrics almost identical to Helvetica and Arial. Nimbus Sans L 
                is one of the Ghostscript fonts, a set of free alternatives to the 
                35 basic PostScript fonts (which include Helvetica).

                In the past, it was used as default font in OpenOffice.org Calc and 
                Impress in some Linux distributions but "they" may have changed to 
                Liberation Sans. OpenOffice now called libreoffice 
                             
                
                If your App is open when you load this package, please close it 
                and on restart, the fonts should be available. Tested on leafpad
                and libreoffice. In impress to change font, go to format character.      

                Compiled for 64 9.x
