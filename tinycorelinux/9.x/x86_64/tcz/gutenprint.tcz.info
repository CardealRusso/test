Comments:       To know if gutenprint is suitable, the list of printers can be
                searched here

                Optional dependency load colord.tcz to reduce
                warnings in error log. Printing still works without it.

                Wireless (WL) Printing
                #############
                For my Canon MG 3060 I found I did not need avahi loaded or running
                YMMV and so you may need avahi loaded and its daemon started but note
                that on first use, you must run the generate-ppd command
                before starting avahi.
                             
                WL ink levels can be checked by using your web browser to 
                go to your static ip for your wl printer eg 192.168.1.7
                -- once the printer is set up

                Epson ink levels, once printer is set up

                How to use ..... if you need avahi  
                ########### 
                # drop avahi if not WL
                $ tce-load -i gutenprint avahi
                
                First time use or if you have not saved the files
                ##############
                sh file starts cups but will not load avahi
                $ sudo generate-ppd.sh

                Next, /usr/local/etc/cups is owned by root so set up a root password 
                $ sudo passwd

                Next, open your web browser to  
                http://localhost:631/admin

                Do NOT click on "Find New Printer", instead click on Add Printer
                Then make your selection. Remember to click the "Add Printer" button
                to then get options to change paper size etc. At some point in that process
                either at the beginning or after selecting your model, a popup will 
                ask for user, input root and your new password please.

                Next (recommended) pulldown administration and make your printer
                the server default. Then test printer.

                For persistence 
                ################
                (1) Add these lines to /opt/.filetool.lst 
                etc/passwd
                usr/local/etc/cups/cupsd.conf
                usr/local/etc/cups/printers.conf
                usr/local/etc/cups/ppd/Canon_MG3000_series.ppd (change to your PPD)
                
                (2) You can choose to add gutenprint.tcz to your 
                boot.lst depending on how frequent you think you might do printing.

                On reboot
                ##########
                Assuming you have done the persistence suggestions, load gutenprint 
                and then start cups with
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/cups start
                and if you are using a WL printer and need avahi
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/avahi start

                ######################
                If you are not sure which PPD is best for you, uncompressed PPDs are
                created at /usr/local/share/cups/model/gutenprint/5.2
                before rebooting and loosing all of them except your persistent ones,
                you may like to copy some into your home dir. CUPS allows you to try 
                a PPD from a non-system pathway.....but for gutenprint it needs to have
                been designed for that version of gutenprint. It may take a few tries
                where you can not find your exact model listed. Good Luck!

                eg you have make Z model 142 so try model 140 then 100 etc
                cups also supplies generic models but these tend to be a bit limited
