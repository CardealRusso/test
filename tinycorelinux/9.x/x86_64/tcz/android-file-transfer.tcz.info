Comments:       One method of transferring files from/to Android/PC
                Does not use udev/rules
 
                If you're happy with gmtp/gvfs/mtpfs or any other 
                mtp software, you might not need this TCZ 
                
                See the website for known problems, eg samsung phones
                are read only. (untested as I have non-samsung)

                Android Instructions 
                - Enable USB debugging 
                -> System settings -> about phone
                -> TAP "build number" 7 times to enable developer mode
                -> Go into new dir and turn on usb debugging

                Data cable is connected PC to a live phone

                On phone enable file transfer (default is charging)
                ---on most androids, its a pull down notification.
                
                PC Instructions 
                ----vary depending on your home persistance,
                commands below are non-root commands
                -> Make a dir to access files EG $ mkdir ~/Android
                -> $ aft-mtp-mount ~/Android
                (you may see this type of error EG # device is already in use)
                -> ignore that error and use your fav File Manager to navigate to 
                that new dir. (EG Android)
                Thunar works as expected. Ditto spacefm

                My error has more info at the website but I can ignore it as
                Thunar or SpaceFM etc still mounted phone
                image of error....and no need to load mtp TCZs

                proof Thunar sees Android OK (not a Samsung)
