                For autostart add this to /opt/bootlocal.sh:
                /usr/local/etc/init.d/openssh start
                Add config files to /opt/.filetool.lst
                to make config persistent if you changed them:
                usr/local/etc/ssh/ssh_config
                usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config
                Add generated keys (8 files) to backup also for persistency
