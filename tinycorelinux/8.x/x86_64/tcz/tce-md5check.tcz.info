Comments:       Extension integrity check  
		Summary:
		A utility for verifying the integrety of each installed 
		extension, then auto updates any which fail.  
		Provides a mechanism for the protection of user modified or user created 
		extensions.  Protected extensions will not be processed, updated or removed.
		Resolves missing *./tcz.md5.txt files and updates as required,
		unless protected.
		Default mode verifies against md5.db from respective repo
		Creates a backup of updated tcz's to safegaurd against inadvertent deletion 
		includes a method to clean up previously updated extensions.

		Integrity verification is the primary intent, however a byproduct of 
		this process has provided a "one-click extension auto-update utility".
