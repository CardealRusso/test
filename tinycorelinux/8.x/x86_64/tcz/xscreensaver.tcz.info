Comments:	----------
		This extension requires GTK2 and its dependencies. OpenGL
		screensavers have not been included. xscreensaver needs to
		be run as root in order to write to the screen.
		To start at boot, create an .X.d\xscreensaver file with:
			xscreensaver -nosplash &
		Configure using xscreensaver-command -prefs.
		This version is built with screen locking and setuid
		support for some savers. Configure options used:
		--with-gtk --with-pixbuf --without-gl
		--includedir=/usr/local/include/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/
		--enable-locking --with-jpeg --with-setuid-hacks
