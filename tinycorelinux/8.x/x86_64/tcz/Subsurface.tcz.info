Comments:	Subsurface can plan and track single- and multi-tank dives using air,
		Nitrox or TriMix. It allows tracking of dive locations including GPS
		coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered using a map
		interface), logging of equipment used and names of other divers,
		and lets users rate dives and provide additional notes.
