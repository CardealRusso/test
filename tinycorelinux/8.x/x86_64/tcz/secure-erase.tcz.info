Comments:	This script will activate an HDD or SSD's Internal Secure Erase command
		as per the ATA specification, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		For more info, see:
		http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/SecureErase.shtml
		**WARNING** continuing past the third dialog window, all
		user data will be irretrievably lost on selected drive.
		This method is additionally recommended to restore an SSD to
		near factory new condition and performance.
		Tip;  Best to accept the NULL password unless one has been previously set.
		Quote from the script
		"According to testing by CMRR at UCSD, nearly all ATA drives
		manufactured after the year 2001 (with capacities >15 GB)
		are integrated with the disk drive Secure Erase command.
		Employing this internal feature offers a higher level of
		secure erasure than block overwriting software utilities.
		Normal Secure Erase will write binary zeroes to the entire
		drive's user-accessible data area, so all data will be deleted.
		(Note: Secure Erase can take 40 to 330 minutes for completion.)"
		Dependencies: hdparm, lsblk (found in util-linux.tcz), Xdialog, awk, sed, BASH.
		This extension is PPI compatible.
