				x86_64, and armv7.

				In particular, armv7 testing is incomplete! Test data

        		submitqc is used to audit extensions before submission.  
        		Run the script in the same directory as the extensions 
        		you want to check. The script will report any issues 
        		with the structure, formatting, etc. Where possible,
        		simple errors will be fixed.
         
        		Results are echoed to the terminal and logged at 
        		/tmp/submitqc 
        
        		The original script was written by Jason W. Various
        		updates and changes have been made over the years by 
        		gordonselfish, coreplayer2, dentonlt, and others.
