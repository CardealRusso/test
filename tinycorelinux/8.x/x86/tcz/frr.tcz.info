Comments:	Frr is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based
		routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1,
		RIPv2, RIPng, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+.
		Frr also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.
		In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Frr also supports
		IPv6 routing protocols. With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and
		AgentX protocol, Frr provides routing protocol MIBs.
		
		The IPv6 kernel modules are not automatically installed.
		If IPv6 is desired, install ipv6-4.8.17-tinycore.tcz via
		the Apps GUI, or cli (tce-load -wi ipv6-KERNEL).
