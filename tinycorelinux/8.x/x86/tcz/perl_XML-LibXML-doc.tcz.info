Comments:       XML::LibXML
                This module is an interface to libxml2, providing XML and HTML parsers 
                with DOM, SAX and XMLReader interfaces, a large subset of DOM Layer 3 
                interface and a XML::XPath-like interface to XPath API of libxml2. 
                The module is split into several packages which are not described in this section;
                unless stated otherwise, you only need to use XML::LibXML; in your programs.
