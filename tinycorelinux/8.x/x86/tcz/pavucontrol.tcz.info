Comments:       PulseAudio Volume Control (pavucontrol) is a simple GTK based volume
                control tool ("mixer") for the PulseAudio sound server.
                In contrast to classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both
                 the volume of hardware devices and of each playback stream separately.
