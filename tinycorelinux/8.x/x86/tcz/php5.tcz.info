Comments:	PHP hypertext preprocessor for TC 6.x, working
                with cgi/fcgi webservers such as lighttpd or apache.
                
                Most extensions has been compiled into binary
                to reduce dependencies and speed up processing.
                There are still some extensions disabled by default;
                if you wish to enable them, just edit php.ini.
		
		The php.ini configuration file is found in
		/usr/local/lib. This file can be editted to
		change the runtime options.
		
		Can be used with apache2 or lighttpd for a
		HTTP/PHP server (probably others too).
		
		For lighttpd:
			make sure mod_cgi is loaded in your 
			lighttpd.conf:
				server.modules = (
					"mod_cgi",
					)
				 
			Then add this lines to the same file:
				static-file.exclude-extensions = (".php", ".pl")
                                cgi.assign = (".php" => "/usr/local/bin/php-cgi")

                        And if you want php file as a directory index,
                        just put the desired filename in next section, i.e.:
                                index-file.names = ("starter.htm", "starter.php")
                                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^
			
			Other server modules that may be needed:
				mod_auth
				mod_access
				mod_accesslog
		
		For apache2:
			Make sure cgi.force_redirect = 0 in php.ini.
			The following, or similar, must be included 
			in the httpd.conf file:
				ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/cgi-bin/"
				AddHandler cgi-script .php
				Action cgi-script "/usr/local/bin/php-cgi"
			The ExecCGI option must be enabled for the
			HTTP server's root directory (htdocs).
			A shebang for php-cgi must also be included.
				#!/usr/local/bin/php-cgi

                There is an embedded webserver for debuging purposes - 
                to launch the webserver you can use the following command:
                        php -S <network_interface_to_listen_to>:<port>
