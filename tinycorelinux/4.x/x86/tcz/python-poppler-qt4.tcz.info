		python-poppler-qt4.tcz provides poppler-qt4
		
		Dependencies: sip, poppler-qt4, pyqt
		
		Building:
		Requires patch by Marek Kasik. Patch is included in
		this extension at /usr/local/share/popplerqt4/. Bug details
		and discussion are at http://bugzilla.redhat.com, bug
		number 822412.
		
		Build dependencies include python-dev and poppler-qt4-dev.
