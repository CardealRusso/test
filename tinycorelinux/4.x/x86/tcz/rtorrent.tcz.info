Comments:       LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus on high performance and good code.
                The library differentiates itself from other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to the network stack.
                On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official client.
                The client uses ncurses and is ideal for use with  screen or dtach.
                It supports saving of sessions and allows the user to add and remove torrents.

                Built with CFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with CXXFLAGS: -march=i486 -mtune=i686 -Os -pipe
                Built with LDFLAGS: -Wl,-O1
                Built with the following options:
                ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-debug --with-xmlrpc-c

                You should move the /usr/local/etc/.rtorrent.rc config file to your home directory!
                Check the configuration and create the proper directories! (/home/tc/.session for example)

                If you would like to use a WebUI:
                Download ruTorrent via svn:
                 cd /usr/local/var/www/
                 svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rutorrent
                 cd /usr/local/var/www/rutorrent/
                 rmdir plugins
                 svn co http://rutorrent.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/plugins/
                Uncomment line: scgi_port or scgi_local .rtorrent.rc
                ruTorrent's config.php also need be configured to either use 'port' or 'local unix socket' connection method
                You also need to configure your webserver: http://code.google.com/p/rutorrent/wiki/WebSERVER

                To control rTorrent you can use the /usr/local/etc/init.d/rtorrent script.
                You will need to install the screen.tcz optional extension to use the init script.

                For man entries you can install the rtorrent-doc.tcz package or visit:
