Comments:       Contains the binaries for non-intel architectures.
-
		Support for all architectures compiled in, both full 
		systems and linux-cpu-emulators.

		As Qemu system emulation is by default completely done 
		in software, it might work better but also slower than 
		alternatives.
-
		Support for KVM included (hardware virtualization).
		This optional feature depends on 
		kvm-KERNEL.tcz.
-
		Kqemu support was dropped in the .12 series.
