Comments:       Surfraw's default browser is set to conkeror, because that 
                was installed when the package was made. :P
                To configure with the text browser elinks for example, edit 
                .surfraw.conf with the following:
                SURFRAW_text_browser=/usr/local/bin/elinks                    
                SURFRAW_graphical=no 
                You will need perl for many search scripts(elvi), such as 
                google, to work. 
                From the docs: If you wish to run the elvi directly, run 
                "surfraw-update-path" to append /usr/local/lib/surfraw to 
                your $PATH in your shell's config files. 
                For any further clarification refer to website or docs in 
                surfraw-doc.tcz.
