Tags:		KDE NetworkManager client.
Comments:	This is a KDE4 plasma widget and a client to the NetworkManager.

		All you need to do is to start NetworkManager daemon on startup.
		To start NetworkManager add to /opt/bootlocal.sh :
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/dbus restart
			/usr/local/etc/init.d/NetworkManager start

		knetworkmanager service is automatically started by kde4 but due to a conflict:
		go to systemsettings->startup and shutdown->service manager and unclick on NetworkManager user settings service

		Optional dependency: mobile-broadband-provider-info
