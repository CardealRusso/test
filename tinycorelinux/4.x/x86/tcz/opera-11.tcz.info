                Since Opera has a low-ram mode where e-mail,
                IRC, and RSS functionality is removed, and
                because it's primarily a browser, the icon
                launches this low-ram mode. Both are available
                in the menu.
                
                Notice that Opera requires a color depth of 24
                to run.
                
                If opera prompts crash error when exiting, you
                need Xorg with appropriate video adapter driver.
