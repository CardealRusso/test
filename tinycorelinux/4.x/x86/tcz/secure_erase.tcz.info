Comments:	This script will activate an HDD or SSD's Internal Secure Erase command 
		as per the ATA specification, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
		For more info, see:
		http://cmrr.ucsd.edu/people/Hughes/SecureErase.shtml

		After the third dialog box warning all user data will be irretrievably 
		lost.  
		This method is additionally recommended to restore an SSD to near factory fresh condition and 
		performance.

		Tip;  Best to accept the NULL password unless one has been previously set.

		Quote from the script		
		"According to testing by CMRR at UCSD, nearly all ATA drives
		manufactured after the year 2001 (with capacities >15 GB)
		are integrated with the disk drive Secure Erase command.
		Employing this internal feature offers a higher level of
		secure erasure than block overwriting software utilities.
		Normal Secure Erase will write binary zeroes to the entire
		drive's user-accessible data area, so all data will be deleted.
		(Note: Secure Erase can take 40 to 330 minutes for completion.)"

		Dependencies: hdparm, lsblk (found in util-linux.tcz), Xdialog, awk, BASH.

		This extension is PPI compatible.

Change-log:     2011/11/22 	removed dep "lsblk" from extension as it's  
				included in "util-linux.tcz"

Current:	2011/11/01 	version 1.1
