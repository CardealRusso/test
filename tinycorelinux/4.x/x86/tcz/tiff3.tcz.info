		Included in this extension is a library, libtiff, for reading
		and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
		manipulations of TIFF images, and documentation on the library
		and tools.
		The library, along with associated tool programs, should handle
		most of your needs for reading and writing TIFF images on 32-
		and 64-bit machines.
