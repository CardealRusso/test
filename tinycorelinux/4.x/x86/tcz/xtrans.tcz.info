Comments:       This requires a video driver that supports the Composite
		extension. I use NVIDIA. This extension will not run without
		it.
		
		In .X.d, I recommend a script containing "xcompmgr -n -D 0.0 &"
		(without quotes) to start the composite manager, then if you
		like, placing:
		"[ -n "$WINDOWID" ] && transset-df -i $WINDOWID >/dev/null"
		(again, without quotes) at the bottom of your .ashrc and/or
		.bashrc files for automatic 50% transparency whenever you open
		a terminal. Looks pretty interesting.
		
		I recommend disabling Aterm transparency in .Xdefaults as well.
