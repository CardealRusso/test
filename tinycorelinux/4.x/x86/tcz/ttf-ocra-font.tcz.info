		In 1968, American Type Founders produced OCR-A, 
		one of the first optical character recognition typefaces 
		to meet the criteria set by the U.S. Bureau of Standards. 
		The result was a font made up of simple, thick strokes to form recognizable characters 
		that could be deciphered by the computers of that day and by humans.
		Specified by ANSI standard X3.17-1977, approved January 20, 1977, and now available as ISO 1073-1:1976.
		The present version by Matthew Skala is newly derived in 2011 from the Wales version 
		(in the Metafont form available at http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ocr-a), 
		and obsoletes an earlier 2006 version from the same author.
		Not every additional ASCII glyph is supplied: notably, ^ and ~ are missing.
