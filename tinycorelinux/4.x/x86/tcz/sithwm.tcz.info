Comments:       essentially evilwm with a menu. 
                sithwm will be looking for a config file. you can: 
		a) load the sithwm-doc.tcz extension which contains 
		   /usr/local/share/sithwm/default.sithwmrc.
		   sithwm will happily find it and use it. 
		b) copy said default to home directory as .sithwmrc
		   (you can now configure to your heart's evil intent,
		   and no longer have to load the doc's extension)
		c) roll your own .sithwmrc in your home directory
