Comments:       The aim of the decorator module is to support other Python executables/modules 
                that utilize decorator syntax, to simplify the usage of decorators for
                the average programmer, and to popularize decorators usage giving examples
                of useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked,
                etc. 

                The core of this module is a decorator factory called decorator.
