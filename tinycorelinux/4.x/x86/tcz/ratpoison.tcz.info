Comments:       Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with no fat library
                dependencies, no fancy graphics, no window decorations,
                and no rodent dependence. It is largely modelled after
                GNU Screen which has done wonders in the virtual terminal
                market. Say good-bye to the rodent!
