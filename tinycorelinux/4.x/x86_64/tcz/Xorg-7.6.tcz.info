Comments:       To run confless, restart X after loading the extension.
		If you need to configure something, such as a keymap, or
		have trouble with autodetection, create a xorg.conf.
.
		== Drivers not included, install xf86-video-all if unsure ==
.
		If you are only looking to get software 3D
		and no accel, instead of creating a config file
		suitable for your hardware like below, you can rename
		/etc/X11/xorg.conf.vesa to xorg.conf.
.
		To get Xorg with accel, exit to prompt,
                get a root console (sudo su), and then
		Xorg -configure
.
		Edit the newly created config file as needed.
		When ready copy it to /etc/X11 named xorg.conf.
		Remember to add this file to your backup (/opt/.filetool.lst)
		or save it some other way.
.
		See Xorg-7.6-3d.tcz for acceleration.
.
		Please note, for AGP or integrated AGP cards such as Intel
		chips you will always need graphics-KERNEL.tcz.
.
		Tips on 3D and X keymaps can be found in
		/etc/X11/README.xorg.conf.
