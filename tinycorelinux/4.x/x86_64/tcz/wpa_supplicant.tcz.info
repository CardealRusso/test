		GUI Interface:	
		Load wpa_gui.tcz, open ControlPanel => Services and activate wpa_gui, then
		start wpa_gui application from wbar and configure your wireless network.
		After setting up your wireless network, choose "File -> Save Configuration" 
		and put etc/wpa_gui.conf to your backup. On next boot, with wpa_gui.tcz loaded
		it should automatically reconnect to your wireless network (without having the
		need of starting wpa_gui again), when you put "/usr/local/etc/init.d/wpa_gui start"
		to your bootlocal.sh.

		Cmd line usage (instead of -Dwext you can also try -Dnl80211):
		$ sudo su
		# wpa_passphrase YourSSID YourPassword > /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
		# wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
		# udhcpc -b -i wlan0 -h box -p /var/run/udhcpc.wlan0.pid
		
		Information:
		Being connected to ethernet _and_ wireless with two DHCP client processes can
		lead to problems like slow connections. As a solution setup a static IP address
		on one of the devices.

		IMPORTANT:
		You will most probably need firmware*.tcz extensions to use your wireless device!
		Since there are lot of them like firmware-atheros, firmware, firmware-iwlwifi,
		please check which vendor firmware belongs to your device.
