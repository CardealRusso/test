                Copy ssh_config.example to ssh_config and
                sshd_config.example to sshd_config in the
                /usr/local/etc/ssh directory. Make changes
                to fit your setup if necessary, but it can
                be used out of box.

                For autostart add this to /opt/bootlocal.sh

                /usr/local/etc/init.d/openssh start

                Don't forget to add these to /opt/.filetool.lst
                to make config persistent:

                usr/local/etc/ssh/ssh_config
                usr/local/etc/ssh/sshd_config
                ust/local/etc/ssh/ssh_host*
