                ----
                Run ntpd as root to start daemon.
                Add /usr/local/bin/ntpd to /opt/bootlocal.sh
                to autostart.
                Default configuration file must work
                in most cases, no customization needed.
                Add /var/lib/ntp to backup to keep drift
                value over reboots.
