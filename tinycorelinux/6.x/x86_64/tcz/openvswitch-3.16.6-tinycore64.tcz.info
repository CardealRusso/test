Comments:       Open vSwitch is a production quality open source
		software switch designed to be used as a vswitch
                in virtualized server environments. 
		A vswitch forwards traffic between different VMs 
		on the same physical host and also forwards traffic 
		between VMs and the physical network.
                Open vSwitch supports standard management interfaces
		(e.g. NetFlow, RSPAN, ERSPAN, CLI), and is open to 
		programmatic extension and control using OpenFlow 
		and the OVSDB management protocol.
