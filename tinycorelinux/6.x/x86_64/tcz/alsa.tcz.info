                ----------
                This extension contains:
                alsa-lib-1.0.28 - LGPLv2.1 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/lib/alsa-lib-1.0.28.tar.bz2
                alsa-utils-1.0.28 - GPLv2 - ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/utils/alsa-utils-1.0.28.tar.bz2
                ----------
                To test sound, use alsamixer to un-mute the master and then:
                $ speaker-test [-Ddefault:1] -c2 -t wav -l1 [change default to suit for multiple cards]
                ----------
		From tc-5.x, it appears that loading the alsa extension is sufficient to initialise sound.
                if this doesn't work, load the alsa-config extension and try:
                $ sudo /usr/local/etc/init.d/alsasound start
		If adding this command to bootlocal.sh, you may need
		to precede it with the sleep command for it to be effective.
		If you want your alsa settings to persist across reboots, use the
		command "sudo alsactl store" after alsa has been set up. This stores the
		configuration in /usr/local/etc/asound.state. Place this file in your backup to
		allow your alsa settings to persist across sessions.
