Comments:       Graphical file manager normally for LXDE
                but can run as stand-alone. Runs on GTK2.

                Warning: all partitions may be automounted 
                but no umount in this app. 
                Use the mount tool to un-mount please.

                Adjust .config/pcmanfm/default/pcmanfm.conf if
                automount does not suit you, etc
 
                Compiled for Corepure64 6.x
