Comments:       Pilot-link is a collection of tools for communication
                with a Palm OS device. Pilot-link supports Linux, OSX,
                and theoretically Windows via Cygwin. Pilot Link is
                used by J-Pilot and other GUI tools.
                This extension includes significant changes to support
                libusb-1.0 and Tiny Core 3.1. Tested on TC 3.1 with a
                Palm Tungsten E.
                Use "pilot-xfer" from the CLI to interact with your
                handheld. Example for 'list':
                     pilot-xfer -p usb: -l -t 5
                For help, see the online man pages or use pilot-xfer
                without arguments.
                This is the base extension. It includes libraries,
                the pilot-xfer binary, and source file for libusb.c.
                Headers and other binaries are in the dev extension.
