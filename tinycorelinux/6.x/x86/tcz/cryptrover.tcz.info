Comments:       You are an archaeologist trapped in an underground crypt
                with a limited supply of air. You must survive long enough
                to reach the crypt's exit. Be too rash and the arachnids
                will nibble you to death. Be too wary and your air supply
                will run out. Luckily the ancients have left behind med
                packs, air cans and batteries - use them wisely!
