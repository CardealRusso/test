Comments:       A fast, lightweight, portable open source browser based on
                Nokia's Qt framework (former Trolltech) and Apple's WebKit
                rendering engine (used in Apple Safari and Google Chrome).
                Note:
                _ Requires no additional dependencies
                - Tested in both Xorg and Xvesa
                - Downloads default to /home/tc, edit preferences
                - Empty non-executable /usr/local/share/QtWeb/unins000.exe
                  file indicates an installed version so user's .config
                  and .local directories can be used for settings/cache
                - The project has been archived, updates unlikely
