Comments:	The FreeRADIUS Server is a daemon for unix and unix like 
                operating systems which allows one to set up 
                a radius protocol server, which can be used 
                for Authentication and Accounting various types 
                of network access. 
                
                To use the server, you also need a correctly setup client 
                which will talk to it, including terminal servers, 
                Ethernet Switches, Wireless Access Points or a PC 
                with appropriate software which emulates it 
                (PortSlave, radiusclient etc).
                
                The configuration files are located in /usr/local/etc/raddb.
                If you don't want it to be recreated every boot, put it
                onto your filetool.lst to make it persistent.
                
                On first-run, after configuring parameters, you will need
                a set of working certificates. You can use bootstrap script
                in a raddb/certs directory to create some testing certs.
                
                Compiled from source for TC 6.x.
