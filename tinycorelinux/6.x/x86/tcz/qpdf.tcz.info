Comments:       An application that does structual, content preserving
		transformations on PDF files. It could be called pdf2pdf
		With QPDF, it is possible to copy objects from one PDF file
		into another and to manipulate the list of pages in a PDF file.
		This makes it possible to merge and split PDF files. The QPDF library
		also makes it possible for you to create PDF files from scratch.
		In this mode, you are responsible for supplying all the contents of
		the file, while the QPDF library takes care off all the syntactical
		representation of the objects, creation of cross references tables and,
		if you use them, object streams, encryption, linearization, and other
		syntactic details. You are still responsible for generating PDF content on your own.
		QPDF has been designed with very few external dependencies, and it is
		intentionally very lightweight. QPDF is not a PDF content creation library,
		a PDF viewer, or a program capable of converting PDF into other formats.
		In particular, QPDF knows nothing about the semantics of PDF content streams.
		If you are looking for something that can do that, you should look elsewhere.
		However, once you have a valid PDF file, QPDF can be used to transform that
		file in ways perhaps your original PDF creation can't handle.
		For example, many programs generate simple PDF files but can't password-protect them,
		web-optimize them, or perform other transformations of that type.
