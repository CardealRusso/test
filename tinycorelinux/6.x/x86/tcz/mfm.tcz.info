Comments:       MFM is a small, fast and lightweight file manager,
                utilizing the FLTK graphics toolkit.
                
                Numerous executables (most can run standalone):
                - mfm       # MFM file manager
                - mfmburn   # CD/DVD burn utility (not tested)
                - mfmcfg    # configure MFM
                - mfmfind   # GUI find utility by name or content
                              (wildcard/size/date filters)
                - mfmhelp   # built-in help, launch from within MFM
                - mfmmount  # partition mount/umount
                - mfmrename # bulk file rename GUI
                - mfmzip    # compress/extract GUI (tar tar.gz tgz tar.bz2 zip)
                
                Minimal yet nicely configurable for:
                - default window size
                - scroll speed
                - file extension and directory colours
                - trash can location
                - preferred editor and terminal
                - preferred open/run applications
                
                Neat features:
                - double-click menubar 'New' opens new window to /home/user
                - double-click menubar 'Change_dir' up to parent directory
                - double-click menubar 'Exit' closes active window
                - 'Exit' > 'Quit all' closes all open file manager windows,
                  but leaves directory browser and partition GUIs open
                - 'directory browser'opens directory tree
                - middle-click opens directory in new window
                - 'select dir' to change directories
                - 'select dir' supports favorites/directory bookmarks
                - keyboard shortcuts for individual directory bookmarks
                - 'select wildcard' selects specified files in directory
                - 'Copy to ...' and 'Move to ...' utilities
                - mount/umount partitions with simple right-click
                - partitions GUI displays freespace of mounted partitions
                - 'Open temporary' automatically mounts and opens partition,
                  then automatically umounts when that MFM window is closed
                  
                Issues:
                - beta software, needs refinement, some bugs
                - dormant, last version release 2006
                - closing last open MFM window doesn't always exit cleanly,
                  may hang, cause high processor usage, require kill
